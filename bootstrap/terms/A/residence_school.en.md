# Residence School
Residence School: A Residence School is the school that a student would normally attend based on where they live. It's usually the neighborhood school that is closest to their home. It's important for the school district to know the Residence School because it helps determine which district is responsible for providing special education services to the student. If a student goes to a different school than their Residence School, there are specific rules that apply to make sure they still get the services they need.
