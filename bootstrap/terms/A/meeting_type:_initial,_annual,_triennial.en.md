# Meeting Type: Initial, Annual, Triennial
Meeting Type: Initial, Annual, Triennial: When it comes to meetings for your child's Individualized Education Plan (IEP), there are three main types: Initial, Annual, and Triennial.

- Initial IEP: This is the first meeting to create a plan for your child if they are newly identified as needing special education services.
- Annual IEP: This meeting is held each year to review your child's progress and set new goals for the upcoming year.
- Triennial IEP: This meeting happens every three years to evaluate your child's overall progress and update the plan as needed based on assessment results.

Additionally, there are other types of meetings that may be needed depending on your child's situation, such as Transition Planning, Manifestation Determination, or Interim meetings if your child changes schools.

Each type of meeting serves a specific purpose in ensuring your child is receiving the appropriate support and services they need to succeed in their education.
