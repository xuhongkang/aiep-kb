# Parent/Guardian
Parent/Guardian: An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is a special plan made for kids with unique needs in school. Parents or guardians work with the school to make this plan. The plan includes goals and special help for the child to learn better. It's important for parents to be involved in the IEP meetings to make sure the plan fits the child's needs.
