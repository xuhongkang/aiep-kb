# School of Attendance
School of Attendance: The "School of Attendance" in the Individualized Education Program (IEP) is the school that your child would go to if they were living at home and not attending a private school. This information is important for making sure that your child receives the appropriate special education services while attending a private school. It helps the school district understand where your child would be going to school if they were not at the private school.
