# Activities to Support Transition
Activities to Support Transition: Activities to Support Transition are things that can help your child get ready to move from school to other activities like college, work, or living on their own. Some examples of these activities include helping your child learn how to budget their money, do basic chores around the house, explore different hobbies like music or art, and seek out opportunities to volunteer in the community. These activities are designed to help your child gain important skills and experiences to prepare them for life after high school.
