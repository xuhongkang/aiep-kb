# Promotion Criteria
Promotion Criteria: The Promotion Criteria you are seeing in the documentation talk about how to decide if a student still needs physical therapy services at school. When the goals in the student's IEP are met, the services may no longer be needed. The IEP team will review the student's progress and check if specific criteria have been met. If the goals are achieved, then the physical therapy services may no longer be necessary to help the student with their goals. The team will also consider any new issues that may come up and update the IEP accordingly. It's important to document the reasons behind decisions and provide clear communication to parents.
