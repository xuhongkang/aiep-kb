# Public Day School
Public Day School: A public day school is a school that is run by the government and is open to all students in the community. When a student with a disability is taken out of their regular school for more than 10 days, the school must provide services to help the child keep learning and reaching their goals from their Individualized Education Plan (IEP). In certain serious situations, a student might be placed in a different school temporarily for up to 45 days. If parents disagree with the school's decisions, they can ask for a fast decision from the California Department of Education. The school district has to pay for special education in a private school if the IEP team suggests that it's the right place for the student. If parents want their child to attend a private school, they have to tell the school district either at the most recent IEP meeting or in writing at least 10 days before moving the child. Children in private schools can take part in special education programs paid for by public funds, but they may not get all the services they would in a public school.
