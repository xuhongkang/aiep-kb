# Probation
Probation: Probation is a period where a student with special needs may have limits on their school activities because of behavior issues. During probation, the school must help the student stay in the regular school program and continue working on their goals in their Individualized Education Plan (IEP). If the student gets in serious trouble, they may be placed in a different school program temporarily. If parents disagree with any decisions made by the IEP team, they can ask for a quick legal review.
