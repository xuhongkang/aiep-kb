Regular Early Childhood Program: A Regular Early Childhood Program is a normal school program for young children that may include kids with special needs. It's like a preschool or kindergarten class where your child can learn and play. The teachers in this program may give extra help to kids who need it to make sure they can learn and have fun like everyone else. This program usually happens at a school and can be for at least ten hours a week. It's important for your child to feel included and supported while they learn and grow.
