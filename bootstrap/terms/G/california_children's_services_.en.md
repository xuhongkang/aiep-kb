# California Children's Services (CCS)
California Children's Services (CCS): California Children's Services (CCS) is a program that helps kids who may need extra support with their health or disabilities. CCS works with kids to make sure they get the help they need at school. They provide special services that are written down in the student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP) to make sure the student can learn as best as possible. It's important to talk about CCS in the IEP meeting and keep track of the services they provide.
