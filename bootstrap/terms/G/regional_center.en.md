# Regional Center
Regional Center: A Regional Center is a place that helps kids with disabilities get the right help at school. They make sure children with special needs have a plan that fits them best when they're in school. If you need more information or support for your child, you can contact your school district or the Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) office. They are there to help you and your child with any concerns or questions you may have about their education.
