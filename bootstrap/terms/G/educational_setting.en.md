# Educational Setting
Educational Setting: Educational setting is where your child receives their special education services, like therapy or extra help in school. It includes information about the type of school your child attends, such as a regular classroom, separate class, or home setting. The goal is to ensure that your child gets the support they need to learn and succeed. The specific setting is decided during an Individualized Education Program (IEP) meeting, where you and a team come together to make a plan tailored to your child's needs.
