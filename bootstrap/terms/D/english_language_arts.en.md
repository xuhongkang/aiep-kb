# English Language Arts
English Language Arts: English Language Arts refers to the subject in school where students learn about reading, writing, and language skills. It's important to make sure students who are learning English get the help they need to understand and participate in lessons. The school will decide where the student gets extra help learning English, like in regular classes or special education classes.

If a student's behavior is causing problems for themselves or others, the school will figure out ways to help them behave better and learn well. The student's progress in tests and assessments will be checked each year, and any needed changes will be made to their education plan to help them succeed.
