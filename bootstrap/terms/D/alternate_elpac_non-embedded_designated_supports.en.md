# Alternate ELPAC Non-Embedded Designated Supports
Alternate ELPAC Non-Embedded Designated Supports: Alternate ELPAC Non-Embedded Designated Supports are extra help or tools that can be used by a student with special needs when taking a test called the English Language Proficiency Assessments of California (ELPAC). These supports are not built into the test itself but are provided separately to help the student understand and answer the questions. They can include things like assistive devices, visual aids, or a different way of responding to questions. The student's IEP team decides if these supports are needed and then chooses the right ones for the student.
