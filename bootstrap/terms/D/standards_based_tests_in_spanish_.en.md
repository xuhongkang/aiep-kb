# Standards Based Tests in Spanish (STS)
Standards Based Tests in Spanish (STS): Standards Based Tests in Spanish (STS) are exams given to students in Spanish to see how well they understand the material taught in school. These tests help teachers figure out what each student needs to learn and how they are doing in their classes. If your child takes these tests, the school might provide special help or tools to support their learning. If you have any questions about these tests, you can always ask your child's teacher or the school for more information.
