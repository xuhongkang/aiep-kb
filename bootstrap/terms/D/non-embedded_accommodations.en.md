# Non-Embedded Accommodations
Non-Embedded Accommodations: Non-Embedded Accommodations are supports that help a child with special needs during tests or learning tasks. These can include things like reducing background noise, using different ways to respond, or allowing extra time for tasks. These accommodations are separate from the regular teaching methods and are not built into the usual way of learning. They are chosen specifically to help the child succeed in school assessments or activities.
