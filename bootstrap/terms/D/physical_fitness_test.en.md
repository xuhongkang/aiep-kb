# Physical Fitness Test
Physical Fitness Test: Okay! A physical fitness test is a test that checks how fit a student is in terms of their physical health. It's usually done in grades 5, 7, and 9 to see how well the student can move and be active. If a student needs any changes to the test, like special help or adjustments, those will be noted too. It's like making sure the student is healthy and strong in their body.
