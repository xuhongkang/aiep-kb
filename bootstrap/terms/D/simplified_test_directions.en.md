# Simplified Test Directions
Simplified Test Directions: Simplified Test Directions help teachers figure out how to test students with extra help, like accommodations or support. You have to pick the options for how the student will take the test, and then choose specific supports and accommodations if needed. The plan must be agreed to by the parent or guardian. You also have to specify the reasons for the assessment and list who will be doing the testing, like a speech and language specialist or a school psychologist. If the student needs special help, like using sign language or extra time, that should be noted as well. It's important for everyone to agree on how the assessment will be done.
