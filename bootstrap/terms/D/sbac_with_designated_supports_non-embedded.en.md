# SBAC with Designated Supports Non-Embedded
SBAC with Designated Supports Non-Embedded: SBAC with Designated Supports Non-Embedded means that when a student takes the Statewide Assessment, they will receive specific help or tools that are not built into the test itself. These supports are separate from the test and are given to the student to help them do their best. This could include things like using assistive devices, different ways of responding, or visual aids. It's important to note that these supports are not part of the test questions but are there to assist the student during the assessment.
