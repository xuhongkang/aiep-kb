# SBAC with Accommodations Non-Embedded
SBAC with Accommodations Non-Embedded: SBAC with Accommodations Non-Embedded means that your child will take the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) test with some extra help but not built directly into the test itself. This extra help could be things like more time to answer questions, using assistive devices, or having someone read the questions aloud. This is to make sure your child can show what they know and can do on the test. If you have questions about this, you can talk to your child's school team.
