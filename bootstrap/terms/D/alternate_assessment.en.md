# Alternate Assessment(s)
Alternate Assessment(s): Alternate Assessment(s) are tests that are different from the usual state or district-wide assessments that most students take. These tests are for students who may have special needs or disabilities that make it hard for them to take the regular tests. The Individualized Education Plan (IEP) team reviews if the student should take these alternate tests and decides it is appropriate based on the student's needs. It helps ensure that all students have a fair chance to show what they know and can do in school.
