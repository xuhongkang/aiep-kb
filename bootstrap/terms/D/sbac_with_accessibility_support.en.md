# SBAC with Accessibility Support
SBAC with Accessibility Support: SBAC with Accessibility Support means that a student is getting extra help to do well on a big test called the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress. This help can include things like having more time to finish the test, using special tools, or getting support with reading and writing. It's all about making sure the student has what they need to show what they know on the test.
