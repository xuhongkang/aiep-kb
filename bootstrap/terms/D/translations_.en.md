Translations : Transition services help students prepare for life after high school. This includes things like learning about college, vocational assessments for jobs, career planning, and job coaching. The school must outline specific actions they will take to support the student's goals. These actions could include activities like college awareness programs, vocational counseling, or work experience opportunities.

It's important to have clear goals and objectives in the student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP). Goals should be measurable and relate to the student's current abilities. For example, a goal might be improving math skills by adding single-digit numbers with 90% accuracy. Objectives break down tasks to help achieve the goals.

The IEP team, which includes educators and specialists, are responsible for creating and monitoring these goals. Parents can provide input but cannot be solely responsible for the goals. The team must meet at least once a year to review the student's progress and adjust the plan as needed.
