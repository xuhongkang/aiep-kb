# Adaptations
Adaptations: Adaptations are changes made to help your child learn better at school. These changes can include things like extra time for tests, special seating, or tools to help with learning. The adaptations are based on your child's needs and are written in the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) to make sure your child gets the support they require to succeed in school.
