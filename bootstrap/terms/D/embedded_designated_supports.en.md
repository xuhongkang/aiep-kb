# Embedded Designated Supports
Embedded Designated Supports: Embedded Designated Supports are specific tools or assistance that are built into a student's education plan to help them succeed on tests or assessments. These supports can include things like extra time, alternative response methods, assistive devices, or visual aids. They are chosen by the IEP team based on the student's individual needs and are meant to make testing more accessible for them.
