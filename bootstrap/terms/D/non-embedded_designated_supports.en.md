# Non-Embedded Designated Supports
Non-Embedded Designated Supports: Non-Embedded Designated Supports are things that can help students do better on tests. These supports are not part of the test itself. They can include things like using assistive devices, providing sensory support, or using different ways to respond to questions. These supports are decided by a team and are not built into the test.
