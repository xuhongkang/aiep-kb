# Functional Positioning
Functional Positioning: Functional Positioning is the term for finding a new behavior that serves the same purpose as the problem behavior. It's like finding a replacement behavior that does the same thing as the behavior we want to change. The idea is to help the student behave in a way that meets their needs in a better or more acceptable manner. This is a key part of creating an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) to support a student's learning and behavior in school.
