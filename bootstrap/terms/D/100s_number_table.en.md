# 100s Number Table
100s Number Table: Okay! Let's talk about Individualized Education Plans or IEPs. An IEP is a special plan made for students who need extra help at school. The plan is made by a team that includes parents, teachers, and other school staff. It helps the student get the support they need to do well in school.

The IEP includes things like:
- What the student is good at and what they need help with
- Specific goals for the student to achieve
- What special help or services the student will get, like extra time on tests or a tutor
- How the student's progress will be measured
- When the plan will be reviewed to see if it's working well

The IEP is all about making sure every student gets the support they need to succeed in school. If you have any questions about IEPs, feel free to ask!
