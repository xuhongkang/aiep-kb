# Noise Buffers
Noise Buffers: Noise buffers help keep things calm and quiet during an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) meeting. They make sure everyone can focus on what's being discussed without distractions. This can include having a professional facilitator from the Bar Association of San Francisco there to help run the meeting smoothly and make sure everyone's thoughts and goals are heard. Noise buffers are like helpers who support you and your IEP team by making sure everyone can communicate well and come to fair agreements.
