Level of Consent: I Agree with the IEP, with the Exception of: When you go to an IEP meeting for your child, you can either agree or disagree with the plan they come up with. If you don't agree with everything, you can say you agree with most parts but not all. That way, the school can help with the things you do agree with. If you only agree with some parts, the school can start those services for your child. If you agree with the whole plan, you sign it so the school can start providing the services right away. If you disagree, the school will want to have another meeting to talk about your concerns. Remember, you have the right to say what you do and don't agree with, and you can ask for changes to help your child better.
