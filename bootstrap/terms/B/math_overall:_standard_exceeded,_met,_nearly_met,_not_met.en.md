# Math Overall: Standard Exceeded, Met, Nearly Met, Not Met
Math Overall: Standard Exceeded, Met, Nearly Met, Not Met: In simple terms, the "Math Overall" section on the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) tells you how well your child is doing in math. There are four levels to show this: 
1. Standard Exceeded - your child is doing really well in math
2. Met - your child is meeting the math expectations
3. Nearly Met - your child is almost meeting the math expectations
4. Not Met - your child is not meeting the math expectations

It's important to check this section to see how your child is progressing in math and if they might need extra help or support.
