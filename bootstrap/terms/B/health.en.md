Health: Health care services are medical services given to a child by a doctor that requires special training. These services, like using oxygen or catheters, are needed during the school day so the child can go to school. Specialized health care services also include things like giving insulin or testing glucose levels.

If a child has health problems that need more than basic school health services, they may get help from a nurse or other qualified person through an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). This extra help could involve managing health issues, talking with school staff, providing counseling, making referrals to other services, and keeping in touch with healthcare providers.

In simpler terms, health care services in an IEP help a child with special health needs get the support they need to stay healthy and do well in school.
