Vocational: Vocational means getting ready for a job or career. In an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), vocational stuff helps students prepare for working and making money. This can include figuring out what jobs they like, learning about careers, getting work experience, or even getting help with job tasks through coaching. It's all about helping students get ready to work and be independent.
