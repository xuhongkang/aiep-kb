# Strengths/Preferences/Interests
Strengths/Preferences/Interests: In this section of the IEP, we want to know what your child is good at, what they like to do, and what they are interested in. This helps us understand how to help them reach their goals in school. It's important to think about what your child is good at, what they prefer, and what they enjoy doing. This helps us create a plan that suits your child's strengths and interests. During this part of the meeting, we discuss your child's strengths, preferences, and interests, and make any changes needed to help your child succeed in school.
