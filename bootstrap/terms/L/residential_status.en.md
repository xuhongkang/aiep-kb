# Residential Status
Residential Status: Residential status means where the student lives or stays. It could be at home, in foster care, in a hospital, or somewhere else. In the form, you need to say who the student lives with and provide contact information for the parent or guardian. 

If the student lives outside their normal neighborhood due to special education services or other reasons, you specify that on the form. You also need to say who has the right to make educational decisions for the student.
