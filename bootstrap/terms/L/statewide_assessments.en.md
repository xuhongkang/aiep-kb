# Statewide Assessments
Statewide Assessments: Statewide Assessments are tests that all students in the state take to see how well they are learning in school. These tests cover subjects like English, math, and science. Some students might need extra help or special ways to take these tests, like using a different language or getting more time. It's important for parents to know about these tests and what extra help their child might need to do their best.
