# Supplementary Aids & Services and Other Supports
Supplementary Aids & Services and Other Supports: Supplementary Aids & Services and Other Supports are things that help a student with their learning. It could be extra help, changes in the way things are taught, or other support. These are listed in the IEP. The school will decide if the student needs these supports and if yes, they will write down what kind of help will be provided.

For example, if a student needs help with transitioning to adult life, the plan will list the services that will be given either individually or in a group. It will also mention how often and for how long these services will be provided.

In the IEP, under Transition to Adult Life Services and Extended School Year Services, they will mark Yes or No if the student needs these extra services. If Yes is marked, they will list out the specific services provided for the student. This could include individual or group activities, how often they will receive the support, and how long it will last.

In simple terms, Supplementary Aids & Services are additional help and support given to a student to help them succeed in school.
