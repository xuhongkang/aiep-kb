# Accommodations / Modifications
Accommodations / Modifications: Accommodations are special things a school can do to help your child learn better. They might change how the test is given or provide extra help like reducing noise or using different ways to answer questions. Modifications are bigger changes, like using alternative ways to learn or skipping parts of the test if needed. The school team will decide what accommodations or modifications are best for your child.
