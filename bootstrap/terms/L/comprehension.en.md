# Comprehension
Comprehension: An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is a special plan for kids who need extra help in school. The plan includes specific goals to help the child learn better in areas like reading, math, and social skills. The goals are set based on what the child needs and how they learn best. It is important to have realistic goals that match the child's learning style. The IEP also protects the child's rights by making sure they are tested based on what they should know for their grade level. It's like a personalized roadmap to help the child do their best in school.
