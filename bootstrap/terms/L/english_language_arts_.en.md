# English Language Arts (ELA)
English Language Arts (ELA): Sure! You asked about English Language Arts (ELA) in the context of an Individualized Education Program (IEP). ELA refers to reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills in English class. In the IEP, if a student is an English Learner, they may need extra help with understanding lessons in English across different subjects. This support can be provided in either the general education or special education setting.

For English Learners, it's important to have goals that address their English language development. These goals should be measurable and related to the student's current skills. The IEP team will decide on objectives to help the student progress in their learning. It's also crucial to consider transition planning for students who are 16 years or older.

In the IEP, there are areas of need, baselines, measurable annual goals, and objectives to track progress. The goals should enable the student to make progress in the curriculum and address any educational needs they have. There must be at least two objectives for each goal, and one goal must focus on English language development for English Learners.

It's essential to provide support for students who may need help with sensory input or alternative ways to respond in the classroom. Additionally, assessments like the English Language Proficiency Assessments of California (ELPAC) are vital for tracking English Learners' language proficiency and progress.

The IEP team will determine the best ways to support the student during assessments and ensure they have what they need to show their skills accurately. Remember, the IEP team should regularly review and update the student's progress and goals to help them succeed in their education.
