# Other State-Wide/District-Wide Assessment(s)
Other State-Wide/District-Wide Assessment(s): State-Wide/District-Wide Assessments are tests that many students take in California to see how well they're doing in subjects like English, Math, Science, and Physical Fitness. It helps schools and parents understand if the students are learning what they should be. These tests may have different types of support or accommodations for students who need extra help. If a student can't take the regular test, they might do an alternate one instead. The school has to tell parents about these assessments and get their permission. If parents don't agree with the test results, they can ask for another evaluation by a different expert.
