# Units/Credits Completed
Units/Credits Completed: Units/Credits Completed refers to the number of class requirements a student has finished. For example, if a student needs 20 credits to graduate and they have completed 15, then they have 15 units/credits completed. It's important to track this to make sure the student is on the right path to receive their diploma.
