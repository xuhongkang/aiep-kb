# Certificate of Completion
Certificate of Completion: A Certificate of Completion is a document given to students who have finished their high school requirements but did not earn a Regular High School Diploma. It shows that they completed their education program, even if they didn't meet all the standard requirements for a diploma. Parents or adult students must be informed before this certificate is granted, and there are specific rules and forms that need to be followed. The certificate is an alternative to a diploma and usually signifies completion of special education services.
