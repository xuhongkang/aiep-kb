# Emergency Circumstances Program
Emergency Circumstances Program: Emergency Circumstances Program is a plan that helps during urgent situations at school. It does not change the regular help your child gets or where they go to learn. This plan does not count as a permanent change. It is a way to keep kids safe during emergencies. It does not mean your child will always get the same things during emergencies as they do on normal school days.
