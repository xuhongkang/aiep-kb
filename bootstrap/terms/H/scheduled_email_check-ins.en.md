# Scheduled Email Check-Ins
Scheduled Email Check-Ins: Scheduled Email Check-Ins are simply regular times when a school sends emails to keep you updated about important meetings for your child's Individualized Education Program (IEP). These emails will let you know when and where the meetings will take place and who will be there. It's important to respond to these emails by checking if you can attend the meeting, signing, dating, and sending the form back to the school. This helps you stay involved in your child's education and make sure their needs are being met.
