# Instruction, Services, or Both
Instruction, Services, or Both: Instruction and services are provided to help children with disabilities learn and participate in school. These can include things like sign language interpretation, audiologic services, specialized vision services, and more. Instruction helps kids learn and services provide support, like Braille transcription or reader services. It's important for the school to provide both instruction and services to help children with disabilities succeed in school.
