# Do Not Consent to the Proposed Assessment
Do Not Consent to the Proposed Assessment: "Do not consent" means you can say no to the school district's plan to test or assess your child. You have the right to refuse to let them do the assessment. They have to tell you what tests they want to do and why. If you don't agree, you can say no. This form explains what tests they want to do, who will do them, and why. If you don't want your child to be tested, you can say so on this form. It's important to understand your rights and make decisions that are best for your child."
