Other: An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is a special plan made for a student who needs extra help in school because of a disability or learning challenge. This plan is made by a team of people who know the student well, like teachers, parents, and sometimes therapists.

The IEP plan includes things like special classes, services like occupational or physical therapy, and goals to help the student learn and do well in school. It's a personalized plan that makes sure the student gets the right support they need to succeed in their education.

If you have more questions about IEPs or need help understanding your child's plan, you can talk to your child's school or teacher for more information.
