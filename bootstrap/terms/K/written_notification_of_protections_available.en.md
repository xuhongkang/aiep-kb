# Written Notification of Protections Available
Written Notification of Protections Available: When the school district wants to make changes to your child's special education services, they must first tell you in writing. This written notice explains what changes are being proposed and why. It also includes information about any other options considered and the reasons for rejecting them. The notice will also mention any evaluations or reports used to make the decision. If you have any questions, you can contact the special education department of your child's school district for more information.
