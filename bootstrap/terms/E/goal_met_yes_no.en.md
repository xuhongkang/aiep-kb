# Goal Met Yes/No
Goal Met Yes/No: The question is asking if the goal was met. You can answer with either "Yes" or "No," depending on whether the student achieved the goal. If the student met the goal, you would select "Yes," and if they did not meet the goal, you would choose "No." Remember, it's important to track and review the student's progress to see if they are reaching their goals.
