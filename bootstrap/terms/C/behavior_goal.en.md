# Behavior Goal
Behavior Goal: A behavior goal is a target set in a plan to help improve or change a specific behavior of a student. It includes what behavior needs to be changed, why it needs to be changed, and what the replacement behavior should be. The goal is written in a way that makes it clear and measurable so progress can be tracked over time.
