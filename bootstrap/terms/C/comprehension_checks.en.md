# Comprehension Checks
Comprehension Checks: When teachers want to test a student's skills, they first need permission from the parents or guardians. The parents can choose if the student will have any special help during the test, like using different ways to answer questions or getting more time to finish. The parents also need to agree to let the school use their health insurance if needed for the student. It's important to talk about what will be best for the student during the test and if any changes are needed to help them do their best.
