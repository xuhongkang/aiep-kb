Materials: An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is a special plan made just for your child if they need extra help at school. The plan is written by a team of people, including teachers and parents, to figure out what your child needs to succeed in school. It includes things like what subjects your child needs help in, what kind of help they will get, and any special tools or technology they might need. The goal of an IEP is to make sure your child can learn in the best way possible.
