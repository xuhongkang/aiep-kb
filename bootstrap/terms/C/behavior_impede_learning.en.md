# Behavior Impede Learning
Behavior Impede Learning: When a student's behavior gets in the way of their learning, it can be a barrier to their education. The IEP team will look at how severe this issue is â€“ whether it's moderate, serious, or extreme. They will observe how often the behavior happens and how intense it is. Then, they will come up with a plan to help the student improve their behavior so they can learn better. This plan might include setting goals to replace the problematic behavior with a more positive one and providing support and teaching strategies to help the student succeed.
