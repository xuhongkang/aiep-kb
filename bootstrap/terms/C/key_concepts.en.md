# Key Concepts
Key Concepts: An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is like a personalized guide for your child's education. It includes information about how your child is doing in school right now, any changes to their learning environment to help them succeed, goals for the year and how they'll track progress, what your child will learn and how they'll participate in tests. It also talks about how your child will be included in regular classes and school activities.

The IEP includes specifics about the services your child will receive, like special education and therapies, transportation, or extra school in the summer. It also mentions when these services will start, how often they'll happen, and how long they'll last. For high school students, there's an added section called the Individualized Transition Plan to help them plan for their adult life goals.

The IEP process involves setting goals for your child's education, understanding how they're currently doing, and making plans to support their learning needs. Reading an IEP involves looking at your child's strengths, areas where they may need help, and the steps that will be taken to help them succeed.
