# Strategies
Strategies: Strategies are like plans that are made to help if a problem comes up again. They are ways to handle the problem safely and what happens after. For example, if a student is behaving in a way that is causing problems, the team will come up with strategies to help them behave better. It's important that these strategies are clear and everyone knows what they need to do. So, strategies are like a roadmap to deal with issues in a safe and effective way.
