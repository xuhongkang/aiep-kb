# Participants
Participants: Participants in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) meeting are the people who come together to talk, plan, and review a student's special education plan. Participants include the school staff and parents working together to make sure the IEP meets the student's needs. The meeting must include at least one parent or guardian of the student with special needs, and parents should be invited early to attend. The meeting is scheduled at a time and place that works for everyone, and the purpose, time, and location of the meeting are clearly indicated in the notice. Parents can also bring others who know the child well to the meeting. Additionally, as part of the student's involvement in the IEP, they can share their thoughts with the team. Sometimes, representatives from agencies providing transition services attend, especially for students aged 16 and older. If a parent can't attend, alternative methods can be used to ensure their participation. The goal is for the school and parents to collaborate on planning the student's special education experience.
