# English Language Needs of Student
English Language Needs of Student: When thinking about the English language needs of your child, it's important to consider how they are progressing in learning English. If your child is still learning English, one of the goals on their plan should focus on improving their English skills. This goal should be specific, measurable, and connected to where your child is currently at in their English abilities. The goal should include who will help your child, what they will do to improve, when they aim to achieve this by, the conditions in which they will work on it, how well they need to do, and how progress will be measured.

Additionally, if your child is 16 years or older, there should be a goal on their plan that focuses on planning for their transition to life after high school, whether it is further education, employment, or independent living. This goal should be tailored to your child's needs and abilities.

Remember, the goals on your child's plan should cover different areas like academic subjects, behavior, social skills, and English language development if needed. Each goal should have specific objectives to help your child work towards achieving them. It's important that the goals are clear, achievable, and based on where your child is starting from.

The people responsible for helping your child reach these goals should be listed on the plan. It's crucial that your child's progress is reviewed regularly, and adjustments are made to the plan as needed to ensure they are making the best possible progress.
