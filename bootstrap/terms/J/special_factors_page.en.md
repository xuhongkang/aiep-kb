# Special Factors Page
Special Factors Page: The "Special Factors Page" is a part of your child's Individualized Education Program (IEP) that considers specific things about your child to help make sure they get the right support at school. This page looks at details like behavior concerns, language needs, and how your child communicates. By including these factors in the IEP, the school can better meet your child's unique needs.
