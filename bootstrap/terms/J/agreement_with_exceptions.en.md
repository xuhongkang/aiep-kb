# Agreement with Exceptions
Agreement with Exceptions: Agreement with Exceptions is when parents of a child with a disability and the school agree that a specific member of the IEP team doesn't need to come to the meeting. This is okay if what the team member works on isn't being changed or talked about in the meeting. The parent and school both need to say it's okay for the team member to not come, and the team member should share their thoughts in writing before the meeting. It has to be written down that everyone agrees.
