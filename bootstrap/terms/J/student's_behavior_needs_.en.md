# Student's Behavior Needs (BIP)
Student's Behavior Needs (BIP): The behavior needs for a student are about figuring out how to help them with their actions that might be getting in the way of learning. The IEP team looks at how often the behavior happens and how serious it is to decide what kind of help the student needs. They might suggest changes to the school environment, teach new behaviors, set goals, or refer the student to additional services. Based on the results of the assessment, a plan to help improve the behavior will be developed, and a meeting may be scheduled to work on it if needed.
