# Assistive Technology
Assistive Technology: Assistive Technology (AT) means tools or devices that help students with special needs succeed in school. These tools can include things like special apps, computers, or equipment that make learning easier for the student. The goal of using AT is to help the student achieve their educational goals. Someone at the school is responsible for getting the AT device and making sure it's available for the student to use. The person responsible for learning how to use the device is also important. Training may be needed for people who will be using the device to make sure they know how to use it properly. The location where the device will be kept and the support provided, like setting it up or recharging it, is also considered. Overall, Assistive Technology is all about using tools to support students with special needs in their learning.
