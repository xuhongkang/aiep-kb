# Occupational Therapist
Occupational Therapist: An occupational therapist is someone who helps students improve their abilities to do well in school. This includes things like sitting properly, taking care of themselves, using devices that help them in school, and more. The therapist can work with students one-on-one, in school or at home, and can help them with different skills like moving their body, thinking clearly, playing with others, and doing tasks that require small movements like writing. These services are provided as part of a plan called an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to help students do better in school.
