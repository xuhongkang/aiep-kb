# Physical Education (PE)
Physical Education (PE): Physical Education (PE) is when a student does activities and exercises to help with their body movements and coordination skills. These activities are part of a plan called an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to support the student's learning needs. PE can include things like learning to balance, move around, and use tools to help with movement. The exercises can be done in different places like the classroom, at home, or with a group or by themselves. The goal is to help the student improve their physical abilities and skills.
