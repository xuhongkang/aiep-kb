# Program Modifications
Program Modifications: Program modifications are changes made to what your child is expected to learn or know in school. These changes can include things like having extra time for tests, taking breaks, special seating, or having the teacher check in more often to make sure your child understands the lessons. Program modifications are put in place to help your child succeed in school by adjusting how they learn based on their individual needs.
