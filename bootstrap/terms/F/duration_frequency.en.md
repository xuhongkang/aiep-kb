# Duration/Frequency
Duration/Frequency: Duration/Frequency refers to how often and for how long a service is provided in an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). For example, if a student receives counseling, the IEP will say how many times a week and how many minutes each session lasts. The duration could be daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. It's important for parents to understand the frequency and duration of each service listed in their child's IEP to ensure they receive the right support.
