# Service Options Considered by the IEP Team
Service Options Considered by the IEP Team: The IEP team will consider different services to help your child. These services could include things like extra help in school, support for transitioning to adult life, or extended school year services. The team will discuss what services are needed and how often they will be provided. They will also decide if the services should be given individually or in a group. In the end, they will choose the best plan for your child's education.
