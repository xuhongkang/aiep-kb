# Language and Speech
Language and Speech: In an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), goals and objectives are like targets and steps to help a student progress in their learning. Each goal should have at least two objectives. For students learning English, one of the goals needs to focus on English language development. For students aged 16 or older, at least one goal should be about planning for their future after school.

The IEP team identifies areas where a student needs help, like in reading, math, or behavior, and sets goals based on those needs. They start by figuring out where the student is at currently, called the baseline. Goals are specific things the student is expected to achieve, like reading or writing tasks, with clear ways to measure progress, such as accuracy or frequency. Objectives are smaller steps that lead to reaching the main goal.

The goals should help the student learn things that are part of the general curriculum or standards for their grade. They should also address any other educational needs, like behavior or social skills. If the student is an English learner, goals should support their English language development. Transition goals help students plan for life after high school, focusing on areas like education, training, employment, or independent living.

It's important for the IEP team to meet annually to make sure the student is making progress and to review and adjust the goals as needed. The main goal is to ensure that the student is getting the support they need to succeed in school and beyond.
