# End Date
End Date: The "End Date" is the date when the special education services for your child will finish. It's important for the IEP team and the education rights holder to agree on this date. This date will never change even if your child leaves and later comes back with a new IEP. The End Date must be accurate and cannot be changed later on. It's essential to document this date in the student's record so that everyone knows when the special education services will end for your child.
