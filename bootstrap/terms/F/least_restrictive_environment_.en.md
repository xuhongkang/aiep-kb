# Least Restrictive Environment (LRE)
Least Restrictive Environment (LRE): Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) means that kids with disabilities should learn with children who don't have disabilities as much as possible. This means they should be in regular classes with extra help if needed. The school has to make sure the student can learn well in this setting before considering separate classes. The goal is to help the student be independent and have access to other kids in school while getting the support they need.
