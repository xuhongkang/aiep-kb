# Start Date
Start Date: The Start Date on an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is the day when special education services begin for your child. This is the date agreed upon by the IEP team and education rights holder, typically the date when you, as a parent, sign your consent to the IEP. This date is fixed and won't change, even if your child exits and re-enters special education later on.

The Start Date marks the beginning of the services outlined in the IEP, such as academic instruction or therapy, and is crucial for ensuring your child receives the support they need to succeed in school.
