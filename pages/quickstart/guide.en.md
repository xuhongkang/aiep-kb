# Introduction to the Individualized Education Program

What is an IEP?

An IEP, or Individualized Education Program, is like a special plan for kids who find learning hard in the usual way. Think of it as a custom-made tool kit that helps your child learn better at school.

### Here’s why your child might need an IEP:

- They struggle a lot with reading, writing, or math.
- They have a hard time seeing, hearing, or moving.
- Paying attention is really tough for them.
- Speaking or understanding others is hard.

The main goal of an IEP is to give your child what they need to succeed in school. It does a few important things:

Makes a learning plan just for your child, based on what they're good at and what’s tough for them.
- Brings in special tools or teachers to help.
- Sets clear learning goals, so your child can keep growing and learning just like their classmates.
- An IEP is there to make sure your child can do their best in school, with all the right support and tools they need.

An IEP:
- Changes with child’s needs
- Involves both parent/guardian and school team
- Shows disabilities that affect child’s learning
- Requires parent consent
- Is a legal contract
