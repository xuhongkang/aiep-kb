# Diving into an IEP

IEPS are complex documents and processes. Here are a few things that can help you understand and navigate the document. There are 11 sections each with its own function.

### What is an LRE?

The school must suggest the best ways to help your child learn and try the best to keep them with their classmates. This is called the [Least Restrictive Environment](https://iep-kb-24839890c1f5.herokuapp.com/kb/F/least_restrictive_environment_(lre).en).

### What assessments are in an IEP?

- Current level of academic performance
- Annual education goals
- Standardized tests
- General education classes

### IEP Goals

[Annual Goals & Objectives](https://iep-kb-24839890c1f5.herokuapp.com/kb/E/annual_goals_and_objectives.en) are what IEP team members think your child will be able to accomplish in a year’s time (“Big” Areas of Concern). Progress Reports show progress on each goal over time.

### What accommodations are in an IEP?

- Changes to child’s learning environment
- Modifications
- Scheduling of Services
- Individualized Transition Plan

### Action Items (How to read an IEP?)

Sign the attendance form, this shows that you were at the meeting. Signing the attendance form does not mean you consent to the IEP.

- If you **Don't Agree** with the IEP, show which parts of the IEP you disagree with. The school will want to hold another IEP meeting to discuss your concerns. 

- If you **Agree with Only Parts** of the IEP, let the school know so the services you agree with can begin for your child. Once you sign the first IEP, you have granted permission for the school to provide ongoing special education services for your child.

- If you **Agree** with the entire IEP, sign the IEP so the school can move forward and provide special education services for your child.
