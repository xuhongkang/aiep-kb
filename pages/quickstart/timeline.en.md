### Step 1: 
Request/Respond to a Student Success Team Meeting with your child’s teacher and the school administrator.

### Step 2: 
Submit a request for a Special Education assessment to the administrator of your child’s school (in or after the Student Success Meeting).

### Step 3: 
The District must approve or deny your request for an assessment within 15 calendar days. This will be done by sending you a Prior Written Notice.

### Step 4: 
If the District approves, it must also send an assessment plan within 15 calendar days of your written request for an assessment.

### Step 5: 
You will have 15 calendar days to review and sign the assessment plan.

### Step 6: 
District has 60 calendar days to complete your child’s assessment (not including days of school break longer than five school days).

Assessment results are shared before or at the first IEP meeting. If your child qualifies, an IEP document is created.
