# You are entitled to an IEP by law. 

IEPs are protected by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), a national law that protects this program and makes sure that every student who needs extra help gets it.

To get that help for free you go through a program called FAPE, which stands for "Free Appropriate Public Education". The IDEA law makes sure of this. See [Here](https://iep-kb-24839890c1f5.herokuapp.com/kb/F/offer_of_fape_-_service.en)
