# Annual Goals and Objectives
Annual Goals and Objectives: Annual goals and objectives are specific things we want your child to learn each year. Each goal has to have at least two smaller objectives to help reach that goal. If your child is learning English, one of the goals must focus on English language development. If your child is 16 or older, one of the goals must be about planning for life after school.

These goals and objectives are based on what your child needs help with in school. They should be things like reading or behavior. We need to know where your child is starting, called the baseline, so we can measure progress. Goals must be clear and include who is involved, what they will do, when it will happen, how much needs to be learned, and how we will measure progress.

The objectives break down the tasks or skills needed to meet the larger goal. It's like stepping stones to get to the finish line. Goals should help your child succeed in the general curriculum and address any other educational needs they have, like behavior or social skills. If your child is learning English, the goals must also support their language development.

Remember, these goals are reviewed annually to see if your child is making progress. It's important to work together as a team to help your child achieve these goals and become more successful in school.
