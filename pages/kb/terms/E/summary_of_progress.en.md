# Summary of Progress
Summary of Progress: Summary of Progress is a report that shows how well the student is doing on their goals in their Individualized Education Plan. It includes information on the student's progress towards the goals, if they are expected to achieve the goals on time, and any additional comments or suggestions for improvement. It is important for parents to regularly check these reports to make sure their child is on track and making progress.
