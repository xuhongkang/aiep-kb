# Goal: Annual Review
Goal: Annual Review: The "Annual Review" goal is a part of your child's Individualized Education Plan (IEP). It is a goal that is reviewed each year to see how well your child is progressing in their education. During the annual review, the IEP team looks at your child's progress towards the goal and determines if your child has met the goal.

You have the option to create a goal from scratch or choose one from a goal bank. If you choose a goal from the goal bank, make sure to adjust it to fit your child's needs. The goal should be specific, measurable, and help your child learn and succeed in school.

The IEP team will discuss your child's progress, decide if they have met the goal, and make any necessary changes to the goal for the upcoming year. It's important to track your child's progress and work with the school to support their learning.
