# IEP Date
IEP Date: The IEP Date is the date of a meeting where a group of people decide on a plan to help a student who needs extra help in school. This meeting happens when a student is first referred for special education services or when a new plan needs to be made. The IEP Date can change if the student is found eligible for help, then stops getting help, and then needs help again. It's important to make sure all the information in the plan is correct and that everyone agrees on the decisions made during the meeting.
