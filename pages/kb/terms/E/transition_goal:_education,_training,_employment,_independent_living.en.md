# Transition Goal: Education, Training, Employment, Independent Living
Transition Goal: Education, Training, Employment, Independent Living: Transition goals in an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) are about helping a student prepare for life after high school. This can include getting further education, job training, finding a job, or living independently. It's about setting goals and making plans to support the student in reaching those goals. The IEP team works together to come up with recommendations and suggestions for how to help the student succeed in these areas. It's important to regularly review the student's progress and make sure they are on track to meet their goals.
