# English Language Development (Note for English Learners)
English Language Development (Note for English Learners): English Language Development (ELD) notes are for students who are learning English. They might need extra help in their main classes to understand the lessons. This support could include help in their primary language or a special English class.

If a student is an English Learner, their Individualized Education Plan (IEP) team will decide if they need extra help in English. This could be in their regular classes or in a special education class. Usually, it's best for them to get this help in a regular class.

For students who are still learning English (English Learners), one of the goals in their IEP should focus on improving their English skills. This helps them keep up with their classmates and succeed in school.

It's important for the IEP team to meet every year to review the student's progress and make sure the goals are being met. They need to consider the student's needs and how to support their learning and development, especially if they are still learning English.
