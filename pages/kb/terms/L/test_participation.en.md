# Test Participation
Test Participation: Test participation is about whether your child will take tests like English, Math, Science, and PE assessments in school. The school team looks at different ways to help your child with testing, like extra time, easier questions, or using special tools. They also decide if your child should do a different kind of test instead. It's important to talk to the school team about what's best for your child when it comes to these tests.
