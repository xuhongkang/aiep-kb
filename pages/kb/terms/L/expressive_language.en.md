# Expressive Language
Expressive Language: Expressive language refers to a student's ability to speak and communicate their thoughts and feelings. It includes how well they can express themselves clearly, use words correctly, and share their ideas with others. If a student has trouble with expressive language, it means they may find it hard to talk or communicate effectively. The Individualized Education Plan (IEP) team will work on setting goals to help the student improve their expressive language skills so they can better express themselves and communicate with others.
