# FAPE (Free Appropriate Public Education)
FAPE (Free Appropriate Public Education): FAPE stands for Free Appropriate Public Education. It means that your child has the right to get a good education at no cost to you. The school must make sure your child gets the help they need to learn, based on their unique needs. This help is outlined in the Individualized Education Program (IEP), which is a special plan made just for your child. The school has to follow this plan to make sure your child gets the support they deserve, both inside and outside the classroom. Your child's education should meet state standards and be supervised by the public school.
