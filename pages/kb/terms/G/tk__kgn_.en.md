# TK (Transitional Kindergarten)/Kgn (Kindergarten)
TK (Transitional Kindergarten)/Kgn (Kindergarten): Transitional Kindergarten (TK) is a special program for students who are too young for regular Kindergarten. It helps kids transition smoothly into school. Kindergarten (Kgn) is the first official grade kids attend, usually when they are 5 or 6 years old.

In simple terms, TK is like a gentle start before Kindergarten, while Kindergarten is the first grade in a child's school journey.
