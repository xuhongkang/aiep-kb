# District of Service
District of Service: The District of Service is the school district responsible for providing special education services to a student who goes to a private school. This district is in charge of deciding what services the student needs, how often they receive them, where the services will happen, and who will provide them. It's important for the district of service to work closely with the student's parents or guardians to make sure the student is getting the right support.
