# Program Setting
Program Setting: The Program Setting section of the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) talks about where your child will receive their special education services. It discusses if your child will go to a certain type of school or program, like preschool or kindergarten. It also mentions how much time your child will spend in different educational environments.

In this section, the IEP team will decide on the type of school or program that is best for your child, such as regular classroom, separate school, residential facility, or homebound/hospital. They will also determine the percentage of time your child will spend inside and outside the general education environment.

It's important to understand and discuss these details with the IEP team to make sure your child gets the right support and education they need.
