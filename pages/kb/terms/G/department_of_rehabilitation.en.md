# Department of Rehabilitation
Department of Rehabilitation: The Department of Rehabilitation helps kids with individual learning plans get special services like physical therapy, counseling, social work, psychology services, and behavior intervention. These services are tailored to the child's needs and can happen at school, at home, or in the community. They're meant to help kids succeed in school and in life by providing extra support and resources.
