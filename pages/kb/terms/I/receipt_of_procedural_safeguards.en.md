Receipt of Procedural Safeguards: Receipt of Procedural Safeguards means getting a written notice from the school district before any decisions are made about your child's special education. This notice explains your rights and protections under the law, called procedural safeguards. It's important for you to receive this notice each year and anytime there are important decisions being made about your child's education. If you have any concerns or questions, you can reach out to the Special Education Department for help.
