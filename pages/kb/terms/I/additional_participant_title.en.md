# Additional Participant/Title
Additional Participant/Title: The Additional Participant/Title section of the Individualized Education Program (IEP) form is where you can write down the names and roles of any extra people you want to invite to the meeting. This could be someone like a family member, a therapist, or anyone else who knows your child well and can help with the planning. It's important to include this information so everyone involved in your child's education is on the same page.
