# Consent
Consent: Consent means saying yes or giving permission. You can say yes or no to having your child evaluated or placed in special education. If you say no, the school can't provide special education services. You can also change your mind and say no later. Make sure to write it down if you don't want something to happen. If you agree to some parts of the special education plan but not all, only the parts you said yes to will happen. And remember, your consent is important and you can change your mind later on.
