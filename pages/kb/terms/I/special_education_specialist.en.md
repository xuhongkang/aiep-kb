# Special Education Specialist
Special Education Specialist: A Special Education Specialist is someone who helps create plans for students who need extra help in school. They work with a team of people, including parents, teachers, and other experts, to figure out what a student needs to learn better. This could include things like special classes, different ways of teaching, or extra support in the classroom. The goal is to make sure each student has a plan that fits their unique needs and helps them succeed in school.
