# Level of Consent: I Agree to All Parts of the IEP
Level of Consent: I Agree to All Parts of the IEP: "Level of Consent: I Agree to All Parts of the IEP" means that the parent or guardian is saying "yes" to everything in the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for their child. This shows that they approve of all the services and support outlined in the plan. It's like giving permission for the school to go ahead with the entire IEP without any changes.
