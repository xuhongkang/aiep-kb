# Parent/Guardian/Surrogate
Parent/Guardian/Surrogate: A surrogate parent helps when a parent can't be found, and they're appointed to help make decisions for a child with a disability. When a child turns 18, they usually take over their own education decisions unless they're ruled unable to do so. When a child is being assessed for special education, the assessments must be fair and not based on race, culture, or gender. The assessment plan must be agreed to by the parent or guardian, and they can authorize access to their child's health insurance benefits.
