# Social Emotional/Behavioral
Social Emotional/Behavioral: Behavioral goals are things we want your child to learn or improve on to help them behave better in school. These goals need to be clear, measurable, and everyone involved should know what they need to do to help your child.

When we talk about "Functionally Equivalent Replacement Behavior (FERB) Goal," we mean finding a new behavior that does the same thing as the problem behavior but in a better way. We also look at positive behaviors we want to increase and problem behaviors we want to decrease.

It's important that teachers and other staff members know their roles in helping your child reach these goals. Reinforcement procedures, like rewards, are used to encourage and maintain the new behaviors. The goals should be broken down into smaller steps if needed to support your child in reaching them.
