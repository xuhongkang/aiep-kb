# California Alternate Assessments (CAA): Not Applicable
California Alternate Assessments (CAA): Not Applicable: California Alternate Assessments (CAA) are tests given to students with significant disabilities to measure their progress in subjects like English, math, and science. If a student's IEP team decides that regular tests like CAASPP or SBAC are not suitable, they may choose CAA instead. In this case, the student is not participating in the regular assessments, and the IEP team has determined that CAA is the best way to measure the student's learning.
