# Performance by Domain: Listening, Speaking, Reading, Writing
Performance by Domain: Listening, Speaking, Reading, Writing: The IEP includes goals for different areas like reading, writing, and math skills. These goals should be based on what your child needs to learn and how well they are progressing. The IEP team will set measurable goals to help your child succeed in school. The goals should be tailored to your child's learning style and be realistic. It's important to have just the right amount of goals, not too many to avoid confusion. It's necessary to have objectives for each goal to track your child's progress. These goals are connected to what your child should know and be able to do at their grade level. Goals should also address English language development and transition planning if your child is older.
