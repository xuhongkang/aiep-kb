# Post-Secondary Transition
Post-Secondary Transition: The term "Post-Secondary Transition" means getting ready for life after high school, like college, job training, or independent living. It involves setting goals for the future and making a plan to help reach those goals. It's important to update these goals each year and make sure the student gets the right support to achieve them. If the goals change, the courses and services provided may also change to help the student succeed after graduation.
