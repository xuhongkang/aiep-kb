# Consent to the Assessment
Consent to the Assessment: This question is about giving permission for testing in school. Before any special tests are given to a student, the parents or guardians must agree by signing the assessment plan. The plan should say why the test is needed (like for the first time, every year, every three years, during a big change, or as a quick check). It should also list the types of tests that will be done and who will give them. The parents also agree to let the district use health insurance to help pay for some services. The form must be signed before the assessment can start. Parents can say yes to the tests by signing, say no to the tests, ask for more tests to be done, or talk about the plan before agreeing. The form also talks about guidelines to make sure the testing is fair and doesn't treat anyone differently based on race, culture, or other things.
