# Social Emotional/Behavior
Social Emotional/Behavior: In simple terms, when we talk about Social Emotional/Behavior, we are looking at goals that can be easily seen and measured to help track progress. This includes making sure all the goals for behavior are clear and listed in the Individualized Education Plan (IEP). It's important that everyone involved knows what they need to do. We also want to make sure that any new behavior being taught will serve the same purpose as the old behavior. This involves clear communication and understanding between everyone working on the plan.
