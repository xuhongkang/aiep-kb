# Notice of Action/Prior Written Notice
Notice of Action/Prior Written Notice: A Notice of Action, also known as a Prior Written Notice, is a written notification that schools have to give parents whenever they want to do something related to a child's special education services. This notice must explain in simple terms: 

1. What the school wants to do or not do for the child.
2. Why the school is making or refusing this decision.
3. Any other ideas the school thought about and why they didn't choose them.
4. Any tests or reports the school used to make this decision.
5. Any other things that are important for the decision.
6. That parents have certain rights under the law to protect their child's education.

Schools have to send this notice before they make any big changes to the child's special education services. It's important for parents to understand this notice to know what's happening with their child's education.
