# Evaluation Area
Evaluation Area: Evaluation Area in an IEP means looking at how a student is doing and deciding what assessments, tests, or records are needed to make decisions about their education. This includes checking if previous goals were met, considering different options, and looking at factors like student preferences. It also involves reviewing existing data and deciding if further assessments are needed to help the student. If more evaluation is necessary, a written report detailing the findings is required. The IEP team, which includes the parent or guardian, will discuss the assessment results and recommendations to determine the student's eligibility for special education services. If the parent disagrees with the school's assessment, they can request an independent evaluation at public expense. The school district must consider independent assessments even if they disagree with the need for one.
