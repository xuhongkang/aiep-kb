# Comprehensive English Language Development (Comprehensive ELD)
Comprehensive English Language Development (Comprehensive ELD): Comprehensive English Language Development (Comprehensive ELD) is when a student gets support in learning English across different subjects, like math and science. This extra help is for students who are still learning English. It includes things like using a bilingual dictionary or providing explanations in the student's primary language to help them understand lessons better. The goal is to make sure the student can access the curriculum even if they are still learning English.
