# Educational Goals
Educational Goals: Educational goals are what we want your child to learn in a year. These goals are decided at a meeting with your child's teachers. They should be specific, measurable, and realistic. Goals are based on what your child needs to work on. For example, goals could be about reading, math, or social skills. Different teachers or specialists will help your child work on different goals. It's important to talk to your child's special education teacher before the meeting to share what goals you think are important.
