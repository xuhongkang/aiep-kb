# Bilingual Dictionary
Bilingual Dictionary: A bilingual dictionary is a book that helps you understand words in different languages. It is like having translations for words in two languages so you can understand them better. If you need to know the meaning of a word in another language, you can look it up in a bilingual dictionary to find out what it means.
