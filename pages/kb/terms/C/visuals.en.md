# Visuals
Visuals: Visuals are pictures, drawings, or other images that help people understand information better. For example, if someone has trouble hearing, they might need a sign language interpreter to show them signs instead of speaking. Or, if a student has trouble seeing, they might need materials in Braille, which is a system of raised dots to read with their fingers. Visuals can also help students move around safely, like learning how to get around their school or neighborhood if they have a visual impairment. These pictures and tools are used to make sure everyone can learn and understand things in a way that works best for them.
