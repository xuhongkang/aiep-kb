# IEP Goals to Be Addressed
IEP Goals to Be Addressed: IEP goals are things that your child's teachers and school want them to achieve. These goals are written down in a special plan called an Individualized Education Plan, or IEP. It's like a map that shows how your child can learn and grow at school. The goals in the IEP are like targets or goals for your child to work towards. The teachers will help your child reach these goals by providing special help and support. Each goal in the IEP is important and helps your child succeed in school.
