# Services
Services: Services are things that help your child in school. For example, Interpreter Services help kids who use sign language to understand what others are saying. Audiological Services check how well your child hears and helps them use hearing devices. Specialized Vision Services help kids with vision problems access their schoolwork with things like Braille or large text. Orientation and Mobility teaches kids with vision impairments how to move around safely. Services like Braille Transcription turn written materials into Braille for visually impaired students. Other services like Specialized Orthopedic Services help children with physical disabilities, while Reader Services provide help for kids who struggle with reading. It's important to know about these services so you can make sure your child gets the help they need in school.
