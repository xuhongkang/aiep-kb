# Location
Location: Location refers to the place where a student receives their special education services. It could be in different settings like a regular classroom, a separate school, a residential facility, or even at home. The location is where the student goes to get help with their education, like therapy or extra support. It's important to know where these services are provided so that everyone involved in the student's education can meet in the right place to help them learn and grow.
