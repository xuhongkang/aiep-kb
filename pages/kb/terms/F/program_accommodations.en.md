# Program Accommodations
Program Accommodations: Program accommodations are changes or help that the school gives a student to make it easier for them to learn. These changes can be things like giving extra time for tests, having special tools to help with writing, or using different ways to communicate. The school will decide what kind of help the student needs based on their individual needs, and it will be written in the student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP).
