# Summative Alternate ELPAC
Summative Alternate ELPAC: A Summative Alternate ELPAC is a test that helps see how well a student who's learning English is doing in school. It shows if the student is making progress or needs extra help. The test can have different kinds of support, like letting the student respond in a different way or exempting them from some parts of the test. The student's team decides if the test is the right fit and if they need any special help during the test.
