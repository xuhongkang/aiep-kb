# Alternate ELPAC
Alternate ELPAC: The Alternate ELPAC is a special test that some students with unique needs may take instead of the regular English language test. The student's team, including teachers and parents, decide if this alternate test is the best choice for the student. Before the test, the team can choose specific supports, like different ways of answering questions or using special tools to help the student do their best. It's important to make sure the student's needs are met to help them succeed during this assessment.
