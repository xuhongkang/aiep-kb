# Embedded Accommodations
Embedded Accommodations: Embedded Accommodations are extra helps or changes that are built into the plan for a student with special needs. These can include things like using special tools or devices, getting extra help with certain tasks, or adjusting how information is given to the student. These accommodations are part of the student's personalized plan to help them succeed in school.
