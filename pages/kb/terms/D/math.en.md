# Math
Math: Okay, so let's talk about the math part of the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for your child. The IEP sets goals for what your child should learn. One example goal for math could be that by a specific date, with some tools like models and graph paper, your child will be able to do math operations like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing decimals with at least 80% accuracy in 3 tries.

The IEP goals are based on what your child should know and do in subjects like reading, math, and other areas based on their grade level. The goals should be realistic and fit how your child learns best.

It's important not to have too many goals in the IEP, as this can be too much for your child and the teachers. It's better to focus on a few big areas where your child may need help, like reading skills, math, or study skills.

The IEP goals are checked regularly to see how your child is doing. You should talk to the teachers to make sure your child is making progress on these goals.
