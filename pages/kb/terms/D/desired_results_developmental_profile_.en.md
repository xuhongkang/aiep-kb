# Desired Results Developmental Profile (DRDP)
Desired Results Developmental Profile (DRDP): Desired Results Developmental Profile (DRDP) is a test for little kids aged 3, 4, and 5 who are not yet in school. It helps see how they are doing developmentally. If a child needs help during the test, the team can write down any special ways to help them do their best. Some ways to help can include using different tools like sign language, picture cards, or even extra time to think and respond. The goal is to make sure the child can be comfortable and do their best during the test.
