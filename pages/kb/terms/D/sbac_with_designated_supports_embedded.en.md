# SBAC with Designated Supports Embedded
SBAC with Designated Supports Embedded: SBAC stands for the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. When it says "SBAC with Designated Supports Embedded," it means that for students who may need extra help or tools when taking tests, these supports are built into the test itself. This can include things like using assistive devices, visual aids, or alternative ways to answer questions. These supports are specifically designed to help students do their best on the test, even if they have unique learning needs.
