# SBAC with Accommodations Embedded
SBAC with Accommodations Embedded: SBAC with Accommodations Embedded means that a student is taking a test called SBAC, which is for certain grades. The test has special help built-in for students who need it. This help is already available during the test, so the student doesn't need to ask for it separately. It can include things like different ways to answer questions, using special equipment, or getting support for things like reading or writing. The student's IEP team decides if these accommodations are needed based on the student's needs.
