# Accommodations
Accommodations: Accommodations are changes and supports that help your child learn better. For example, they might get more time for tests, breaks for their brain, a special place to sit, or help from the teacher. These changes are based on what your child needs to do well in school. Accommodations can also include options like using sign language, pictures, or special equipment to help with learning. Remember, accommodations are about making things easier for your child so they can succeed in school.
