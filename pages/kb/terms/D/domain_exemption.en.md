# Domain Exemption
Domain Exemption: Domain exemption refers to the process of allowing a team member of the Individualized Education Program (IEP) to not attend the meeting if their area of focus is not going to be discussed or changed during the meeting. This can happen when the parent and the school agree that the team member's presence is not necessary. The team member must provide input in writing to the parent and the IEP team before the meeting. This agreement must be made in advance of the meeting, not on the same day.
