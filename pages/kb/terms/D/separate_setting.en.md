# Separate Setting
Separate Setting: Separate Setting means the place where your child gets extra help or special classes in school. It could be a different school, classroom, or even at home. The IEP team can decide if your child needs to be in a separate setting to get the right support. Just remember, it's all about finding the best place for your child to learn and grow.
