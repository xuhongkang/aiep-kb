# Designated Supports
Designated Supports: Designated supports are like tools or help given to a student during tests or lessons to make things easier for them. This can include things like extra time on a test, using a calculator, or having someone read questions aloud. The school team decides what supports are needed based on what will help the student do their best. Remember, these supports are there to help the student learn and show what they know.
