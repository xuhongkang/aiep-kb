# Initial Alternate ELPAC
Initial Alternate ELPAC: An Initial Alternate ELPAC is a special test for students who need different ways to show what they know because of challenges like disabilities. The student's team decides if they should take this test and what support or changes they might need to do their best. It's important to choose the right supports, like reducing noise or helping with communication, to help the student succeed. This test is different from the regular ELPAC test given to English learners to see how well they understand and use English.
