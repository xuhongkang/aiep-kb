# Next Eval
Next Eval: The "Next Eval" is when the school team decides if your child needs more testing to help create their Individualized Education Plan (IEP). This evaluation is done every three years. The school checks if they have looked at all the information they have about your child, like test results and teacher observations. If they think more testing is needed, they will do specific assessments. If no more testing is needed, they will explain why. It's important for you to be part of this decision-making process, but your signature is not required.
