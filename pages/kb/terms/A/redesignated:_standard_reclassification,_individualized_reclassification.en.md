Redesignated: Standard Reclassification, Individualized Reclassification: Redesignated means changed or moved to a different group. In the context of an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), it could refer to when a student is moved from being classified as an English Learner to being classified as Fluent in English, which means they no longer need special language support. It's like saying the student has improved their English skills enough to not need extra help anymore.
