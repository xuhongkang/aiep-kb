# Last Eval
Last Eval: The "Last Eval" field in an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is the date of the most recent assessment done to decide if a student still needs special education services. This date helps track when the next assessment is due, usually every three years, to see if the student still qualifies for these services. It is important to keep this date accurate to ensure the student's needs are being met.
