# Indicate Disabilities: Primary, Secondary, *Low Incidence Disability, Not Eligible for Special Education, Exiting from Special Education
Indicate Disabilities: Primary, Secondary, *Low Incidence Disability, Not Eligible for Special Education, Exiting from Special Education: I'm going to explain the terms in a simple way:

- **Primary Disability**: The main problem that makes it hard for the student to learn in a regular class.
- **Secondary Disability**: Another difficulty the student has but not the main one.
- **Low Incidence Disability**: A rare condition that affects learning (like being deaf or blind).
- **Not Eligible for Special Education**: The student doesn't qualify for extra help in school.
- **Exiting from Special Education**: The student is finishing or leaving the extra help they were getting.

Let me know if you need more help or explanation!
