# Residency
Residency: Residency means where the student lives and goes to school. It can be in the same district where the parents live, or in a different district if there are special circumstances. The district where the student gets special education services is called the "District of Special Education Accountability" and can be based on where the student lives or other factors like attending a charter school or being in a specific facility. The "Residence School" is just the neighborhood school where the student would normally go.
