# Next Annual IEP
Next Annual IEP: The "Next Annual IEP" refers to a meeting that happens once a year to look at your child's progress in school and make any changes to their education plan if needed. If you or the teacher feel that your child isn't learning well or reaching their goals, you can request a meeting to update the IEP. You can send a written request to the school, and they must have the meeting within 30 days.

During this meeting, you'll review your child's current performance, set new goals, make any necessary changes to their learning environment, and plan for the upcoming year. It's important to work together with the school to create a plan that best supports your child's needs.
