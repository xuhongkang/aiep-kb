# Offer of FAPE (Free Appropriate Public Education)
Offer of FAPE (Free Appropriate Public Education): The Offer of FAPE (Free Appropriate Public Education) means that schools must provide special education services to children with disabilities at no cost to parents. If a child is moved to a private school without the school district's permission, the district may not have to provide special education unless they've already offered it. Parents can request public funding for their child's private school placement, but the district must first evaluate and approve the placement. If the district didn't offer FAPE in a timely manner before the private school enrollment, they may have to reimburse the parent for the special education costs. Parents have rights to refuse consent and their child's information is confidential. Schools cannot require parents to enroll in public benefits to receive special education services. If a child turns 18, their rights under special education may transfer to them, unless they are determined incompetent. Parents have the right to request assessments for their child in all areas of suspected disability, using non-discriminatory methods.
