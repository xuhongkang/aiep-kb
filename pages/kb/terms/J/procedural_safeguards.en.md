# Procedural Safeguards
Procedural Safeguards: Procedural safeguards are rules to make sure that your child gets the right services in school. This includes things like having meetings to decide what help your child needs, making plans for your child's education, and protecting your rights as a parent. If you have concerns about your child's education, you can talk to the school to solve the problem. Remember, you have the right to be involved in decisions about your child's education, and the school must explain everything clearly to you.
