# Accommodations/Modifications
Accommodations/Modifications: Accommodations/Modifications are changes that help your child in school. They can include things like reducing noise, changing how a child responds, or using tools like calculators. These changes are decided by the IEP team to help your child learn better. Accommodations are like giving extra help, while modifications change how things are taught. Remember, accommodations don't make things easier, they just help your child learn in a different way.
