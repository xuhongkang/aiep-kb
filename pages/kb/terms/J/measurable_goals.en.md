# Measurable Goals
Measurable Goals: Measurable Goals are like targets that the school sets for your child to achieve within a year. These goals are based on what your child can do now and what they can learn. They need to be specific, easy to measure, and have a clear timeline for completion. It's important that these goals relate to what your child needs help with and are written in a clear, understandable way. Remember, these goals are meant to help your child improve and succeed in their learning.
