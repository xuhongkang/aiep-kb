# Parent/Adult Student Acknowledgements
Parent/Adult Student Acknowledgements: These forms are like letters that tell parents or adult students about changes in their child's education. They also provide options for different types of diplomas or certificates. The forms need to be filled out with the student's name, dates, and reasons for the decision made by the school district. There are also sections where parents need to give their consent for things like assessments or access to health benefits. It's important to read and understand these forms before signing them.
