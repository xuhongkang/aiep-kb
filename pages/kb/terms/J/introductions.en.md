# Introductions
Introductions: Introductions mean saying hello and explaining why we are having a meeting. It helps everyone know what to expect and who will be talking. At the start of the meeting, people introduce themselves and explain their role. This helps to make sure everyone knows who is there and why. A meeting usually starts by talking about why we are meeting, how long it will take, and who will be speaking. Then, everyone shares a little bit about themselves and the student we are talking about. It's important for parents to share their thoughts too because everyone's input is needed.
