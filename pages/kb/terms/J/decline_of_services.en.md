# Decline of Services
Decline of Services: When services are declined in special education, it means that the student won't receive certain supports or programs that were originally offered to help them in school. This decision might be made by the team that creates the student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP). The team could decide that the student no longer needs a particular service, or it may not be the best fit for the student anymore. It's important to discuss these changes with the school to ensure the student's needs are being met properly.
