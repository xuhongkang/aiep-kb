# Goals Review and Development
Goals Review and Development: In simple terms, during the goals review and development process in an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), the team can create new goals from scratch or choose from pre-made templates called goal banks. It's important to customize the goals to fit the student's specific needs and make sure they are measurable and clear.

When reviewing progress on previous goals, you can keep them in the IEP document for reference while adding new goals based on the team's decisions. Each goal should address areas of need identified in the student's performance, and there should be someone responsible for implementing and monitoring each goal.

Goals should be developed based on the student's disability, current abilities, and potential for growth. They should be measurable, achievable, and related to the student's needs, such as reading, writing, math, or speech. It's recommended to create "SMART goals" that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Results-Oriented, and Time-bound.

Different team members, such as special education teachers or speech therapists, may be responsible for carrying out specific goals. It's essential to clearly define who will provide each service and where and how it will be delivered.

Overall, the IEP goals are designed to help your child make progress in their education and address their individual needs, with input from both parents and school staff.
