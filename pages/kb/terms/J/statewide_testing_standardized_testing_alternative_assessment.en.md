# Statewide Testing/Standardized Testing/Alternative Assessment
Statewide Testing/Standardized Testing/Alternative Assessment: Statewide Testing is when all students in a state take the same test to see how well they're learning. It helps schools know if students are doing well and if they need extra help. Standardized Testing is a type of test that is the same for everyone and helps compare students across schools. Alternative Assessment is a different kind of test for students who need it based on their unique needs or disabilities. It helps measure their progress in a different way than the regular tests.
