# Understanding Foundational
Understanding Foundational: Understanding foundational refers to identifying and addressing the fundamental skills and knowledge that a student needs to succeed in their education. This includes focusing on basic concepts like reading, writing, and math, as well as social and emotional skills. By understanding what foundational skills a student needs, educators can tailor interventions and support through an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to help the student make progress in these areas.
