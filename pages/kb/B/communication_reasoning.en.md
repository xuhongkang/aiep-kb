# Communication Reasoning
Communication Reasoning: Communication reasoning refers to the ability to understand and express thoughts, feelings, and ideas effectively through spoken, written, or nonverbal means. In the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), communication reasoning goals may be included to support students who struggle with communication skills. These goals can focus on improving verbal expression, listening comprehension, social communication, or augmentative and alternative communication methods. By addressing communication reasoning in an IEP, students can receive targeted support to enhance their ability to communicate effectively in various settings.
