# Limited Understanding
Limited Understanding: Limited understanding refers to a situation where a student struggles to grasp concepts or information at the expected level for their age or grade. It may be due to various factors such as learning disabilities, language barriers, or difficulties with processing information. When a student has limited understanding, it can impact their ability to participate fully in class, complete assignments, and demonstrate their knowledge. Schools can address this by providing individualized support through an Individualized Education Program (IEP) tailored to the student's specific needs.
