# Standard Exceeded/Met/Nearly Met/Not Met
Standard Exceeded/Met/Nearly Met/Not Met: When evaluating a student's progress in an Individualized Education Program (IEP), educators use the terms Standard Exceeded, Met, Nearly Met, or Not Met to describe how well the student is meeting the educational standards or goals set in the IEP. Standard Exceeded means the student has exceeded the expectations, Standard Met means the student has successfully met the expectations, Nearly Met indicates the student is close to meeting the expectations but may need additional support, and Not Met means the student has not yet achieved the desired level. These terms help track the student's performance and guide future planning and support in the IEP.
