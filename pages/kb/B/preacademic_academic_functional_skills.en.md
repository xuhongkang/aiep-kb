# Preacademic/Academic/Functional Skills
Preacademic/Academic/Functional Skills: Preacademic, academic, and functional skills refer to different types of abilities that are addressed in Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) to help students with special needs reach their educational goals. Preacademic skills include foundational knowledge such as basic counting, shapes, colors, and letter recognition needed for academic success. Academic skills involve traditional subject areas like reading, writing, math, science, and social studies. Functional skills are daily living skills like personal hygiene, time management, and safety practices that promote independence and well-being. These skills are identified, targeted, and developed in an individualized manner within the IEP to support the student's learning and growth.
