# Concepts And Procedures
Concepts And Procedures: Concepts and procedures in the context of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) refer to the specific skills, knowledge, and methods that are identified as necessary for a student's educational success. These can include academic concepts like math or reading comprehension, as well as practical skills like communication or organizational strategies. Procedures outline the steps, tools, and support systems that will be put in place to help the student learn and demonstrate their understanding of these concepts. By including concepts and procedures in an IEP, educators can tailor instruction to meet the unique needs of each student.
