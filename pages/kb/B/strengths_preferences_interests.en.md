# Strengths/Preferences/Interests
Strengths/Preferences/Interests: Strengths/Preferences/Interests (SPI) are essential aspects to consider when creating an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for a student. SPI refer to the unique abilities, likes, and activities that a student excels in, enjoys, and finds motivating. It is important for educators and IEP team members to identify a student's SPI to tailor instructional strategies and goals that promote engagement, success, and overall well-being. By incorporating SPI into the IEP, educators can help students build on their strengths, pursue their interests, and stay motivated to learn and grow.
