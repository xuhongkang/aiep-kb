# Occupational Therapy
Occupational Therapy: Occupational therapy is a type of therapy that helps people of all ages improve their ability to perform daily activities and tasks. It focuses on enhancing skills needed for school, work, and daily life, such as fine motor skills, coordination, and sensory processing. Occupational therapists work with individuals to develop personalized strategies and tools to overcome physical, emotional, or cognitive challenges. They may provide exercises, tools, or modifications to help individuals succeed in their environments. Occupational therapy can be a valuable component of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for students who require support to fully access and participate in their education.
