# Communication Development
Communication Development: Communication development refers to the process by which children learn to understand and use language to communicate effectively with others. This includes the ability to listen, speak, read, and write. Communication skills are essential for academic success, social interactions, and daily functioning. Children develop these skills at their own pace, with some needing extra support to reach their full potential. In an Individualized Education Program (IEP), communication development goals are personalized to address a student's specific needs and may include strategies to improve language comprehension, vocabulary, grammar, social communication, and articulation.
