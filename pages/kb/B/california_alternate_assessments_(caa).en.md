# California Alternate Assessments (Caa)
California Alternate Assessments (Caa): The California Alternate Assessments (CAA) are tests specifically designed for students with significant cognitive disabilities who are unable to take the standard state assessments, even with accommodations. The CAA aims to assess these students' knowledge and skills in English language arts, mathematics, and science. The assessments are aligned with grade-level content but are modified to be more accessible to students with disabilities. The goal of the CAA is to provide a fair and accurate way to measure the academic progress of these students and ensure they receive appropriate support and resources.
