# Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (Sbac)
Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (Sbac): The Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) is a group of states working together to develop assessments that measure student knowledge and skills in English language arts/literacy and math. The assessments are designed to be more comprehensive and challenging than traditional tests to better prepare students for college and careers. These assessments are aligned with state academic standards and provide valuable information to teachers, parents, and students about a student's progress and areas for improvement.
