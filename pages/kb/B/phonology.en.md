# Phonology
Phonology: Phonology is the study of how sounds function in languages. It focuses on the specific sounds that are used in a language, how they are organized, and how they can change meanings. Phonology helps us understand the patterns of sounds in words and how they are used to create meaning in speech. It is an important aspect of language development and can impact a child's ability to pronounce words correctly and understand the spoken language.
