# Positive Behavior Interventions
Positive Behavior Interventions: Positive Behavior Interventions are strategies used to help students with special needs improve their behavior in school settings. These interventions focus on teaching and reinforcing positive behaviors to replace challenging behaviors. By using positive reinforcement, goal setting, and support, students can learn appropriate ways to behave in class and school. Positive Behavior Interventions are often included in Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) to support students in reaching their academic and behavioral goals.
