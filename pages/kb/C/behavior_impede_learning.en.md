# Behavior Impede Learning
Behavior Impede Learning: Behavior impeding learning refers to actions or conduct of a student that disrupts the learning environment and hinders their ability to make educational progress. These behaviors can range from being disruptive in class, not following instructions, being aggressive towards others, or not completing assigned tasks. Addressing behavior that impedes learning is an important aspect of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) as it outlines strategies and interventions to support the student in managing and improving their behaviors to enhance their educational outcomes.
