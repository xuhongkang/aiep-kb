# Frontloading
Frontloading: Frontloading is a teaching strategy where information or skills are introduced to students before they engage in a learning activity. This helps prepare students for the task at hand by providing them with the necessary background knowledge or tools to successfully complete the activity. In the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), frontloading can be used to introduce new concepts or strategies to students with special needs before they are expected to use them in their learning. By frontloading information, educators can support students in understanding and applying new skills more effectively.
