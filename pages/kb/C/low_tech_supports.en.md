# Low Tech Supports
Low Tech Supports: Low tech supports are simple and cost-effective tools or strategies that help students with individualized education programs (IEPs) access curriculum and succeed in the classroom. These may include items such as graphic organizers, visual schedules, timers, pencil grips, or even a slant board to help with writing. These supports do not require technology and can be easily implemented in the classroom or at home to assist students in their learning. Low tech supports are tailored to each student's specific needs and are typically written into their IEP to ensure they receive the necessary assistance for academic success.
