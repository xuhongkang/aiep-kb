# Bilingual Dictionary
Bilingual Dictionary: A bilingual dictionary is a reference book that provides word translations between two languages. It helps individuals who are learning a new language or need to understand unfamiliar words in a different language. Bilingual dictionaries typically list words alphabetically along with their corresponding translations, pronunciations, and sometimes definitions. They are useful tools for students, travelers, language enthusiasts, and anyone seeking to bridge language barriers.
