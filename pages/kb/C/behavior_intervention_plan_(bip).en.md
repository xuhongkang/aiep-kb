# Behavior Intervention Plan (Bip)
Behavior Intervention Plan (Bip): A Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP) is a document that outlines strategies and supports designed to address challenging behaviors in students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). The BIP identifies specific behaviors of concern, the factors contributing to those behaviors, and interventions to help the student learn more appropriate behavior. It is created collaboratively by a team, including parents, teachers, and specialists, and is tailored to the unique needs of the student. The goal of a BIP is to promote positive behavior and create a supportive environment for the student to succeed academically and socially.
