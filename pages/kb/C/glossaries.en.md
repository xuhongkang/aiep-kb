# Glossaries
Glossaries: Glossaries are like dictionaries that provide definitions and explanations of terms used in a specific field or subject. In the context of education, a glossary can help parents understand the language and terminology commonly used in Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). By referring to a glossary, parents can clarify any unfamiliar terms and better advocate for their child's educational needs.
