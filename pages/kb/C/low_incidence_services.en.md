# Low Incidence Services
Low Incidence Services: Low incidence services refer to specialized educational services that are required by a small number of students with significant disabilities. These services may include things like occupational therapy, physical therapy, or specialized medical care. Students who need low incidence services usually require individualized support to address their unique needs and help them access the curriculum. These services are provided as part of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to ensure that each student receives the appropriate support for their educational and developmental goals.
