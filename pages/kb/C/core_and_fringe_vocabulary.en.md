# Core And Fringe Vocabulary
Core And Fringe Vocabulary: Core vocabulary refers to the set of high-frequency words that are most commonly used across different settings and contexts. These words are essential for effective communication and are often included in communication devices or systems for individuals who have challenges with speech or language. On the other hand, fringe vocabulary consists of less common, specialized, or topic-specific words that are not used as frequently. While core vocabulary forms the foundation of communication, fringe vocabulary allows individuals to express specific ideas, preferences, or interests beyond basic communication needs.
