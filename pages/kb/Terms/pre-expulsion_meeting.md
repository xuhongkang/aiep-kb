# **Pre-Expulsion IEP Meeting**: 
A meeting that happens if a student with disabilities might be expelled, or removed, from school because of their behavior.

### **Purpose**:
- **Review Behavior**: To look closely at what happened and why.
- **Disability Connection**: To decide if the student's behavior is because of their disability.
- **Find Solutions**: To think about ways to help the student, like different support or changes in how they learn, to prevent this behavior in the future.

### **Why It's Important**:
- Makes sure the school understands the student's needs and doesn't punish them for something related to their disability.
- Tries to find better ways to support the student so they can stay in school and learn.

### **What Happens**:
- The team talks about the student's behavior and any past issues.
- They check the student's IEP to see if it needs changes to help them behave better.
- They consider if the school did everything right to support the student before thinking about expulsion.

### **Who's Involved**:
- The student (if appropriate), their parents or guardians, teachers, and other school staff who know about the student's needs and rights.

### **Goal**: 
To protect the student's right to education by finding positive ways to address behavior issues, ensuring any decisions consider the student's disability and need for support."
