# Standard Reclassification:
This is when a student who is learning English (an English Learner or EL) meets the set requirements to be considered fluent in English. These requirements are usually about how well they understand, speak, read, and write in English. It's like passing a big test that shows they can use English just like students who have always spoken it.

### Purpose:

To show that a student has learned English well enough to not need special English lessons anymore.
To help the student move on to focusing more on other subjects without the extra English support.
How It Happens:

The student takes tests that check their English skills.
Teachers and the school look at the test results and other things, like how well the student does in class.
If everything looks good, the school decides the student is fluent in English."
