# Individualized Reclassification

This process is more personalized. It means looking very closely at a student who is learning English and also has special education needs. Because every student is different, especially those with special needs, the school might use different ways to decide if they're ready to be called fluent in English.

Purpose:

To make sure that decisions about a student's English skills are fair and take into account their unique learning needs.
To find the best way to support the student's learning, considering both their English learning and any special education services they receive.
How It Happens:

The team that works with the student, including teachers and special education staff, talks about the best way to see if the student has learned English.
They might use special tests or other ways to check the student's English that are right for them.
They think about the student's special education plan and how they're doing in school to decide if they're fluent in English.
Both Ways:

Are about making sure students get the right help to succeed in school.
Involve looking at how well a student has learned English.
Include discussions and decisions by people who know and work with the student.
