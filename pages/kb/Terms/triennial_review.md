# **Triennial Review**: 
A detailed check-up of a student's special education plan that happens every three years or sooner if needed. It's like a big review to make sure everything is still working well for the student.

### **Purpose**:
- To see if the student still needs special education.
- To update the student's learning plan based on their current needs.

### **Who Does It?** 
Professionals who are good at understanding the student's main way of talking (like oral or sign language) and who know about the student's cultural background. Sometimes, an interpreter might help with this.

### **Steps in the Review**:
1. **Look at What We Know**: First, the team looks at all the information they already have, like past tests, what teachers and parents say, and how the student is doing in class.
2. **Decide What Else We Need to Know**: Based on what the parents say and what they've already reviewed, the team decides if they need more information to:
   - Check if the student still qualifies as having a disability.
   - Understand the student's current learning levels and needs.
   - Decide if the student still needs special help or if changes are needed to help the student reach their goals.

### **File Review Option**: 
Sometimes, just looking at the student's file is enough to decide if they still need special education. The team writes a summary and talks about it.

### **Parent Rights**:
- Parents get a letter telling them what the team thinks and why. It also says parents can ask for more checks if they disagree.
- The school must ask parents before doing this big review. They try hard to get parent's permission and keep track of their efforts.

### **Main Goal**: 
To make sure the student's education plan fits their current needs and helps them learn the best they can."
