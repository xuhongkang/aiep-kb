# Academic Achievement
Academic Achievement: Academic achievement refers to a student's success in school, including their grades, test scores, and overall performance in various subjects. It is a measure of how well a student is meeting the academic expectations and standards set by their school. Academic achievement is important in assessing a student's progress and determining if they are making sufficient growth in their learning. It can be used to identify areas where a student may need extra support or modifications in their Individualized Education Program (IEP) to help them succeed academically.
