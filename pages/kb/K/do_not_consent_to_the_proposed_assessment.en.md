# Do Not Consent To The Proposed Assessment
Do Not Consent To The Proposed Assessment: When a school suggests an assessment for a child's Individualized Education Program (IEP), parents have the right to refuse or 'not consent' to this evaluation. By doing so, they are indicating that they do not agree for the assessment to take place. This decision can lead to discussions with the school to find alternative ways to understand the child's needs and make decisions for their education. It's important for parents to be informed about their rights and options when it comes to assessments for IEPs.
