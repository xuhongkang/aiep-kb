# Initial Plan Review
Initial Plan Review: An Initial Plan Review is a meeting that typically takes place within a few weeks after the Individualized Education Program (IEP) has been developed for a student with special needs. During this review, the IEP team, which includes parents or guardians, teachers, special education staff, and sometimes the student, comes together to discuss and ensure that the IEP is appropriate and effective for the student's needs. They may review the student's progress, discuss any changes needed to the plan, and make any necessary adjustments to help the student succeed academically and socially.
