# Notice Of Action/Prior Written Notice
Notice Of Action/Prior Written Notice: Notice of Action, also known as Prior Written Notice, is a formal written document that parents receive from the school when there is a proposed change in the child's Individualized Education Program (IEP) or if the school plans to refuse a requested action by the parent. This notice outlines the proposed changes, the reasons for the changes, and the information considered in making the decision. It gives parents the opportunity to understand and respond to any changes or denials in the child's education plan. Prior Written Notice helps ensure transparency and communication between parents and the school regarding the child's special education services.
