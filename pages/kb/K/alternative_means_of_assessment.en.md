# Alternative Means Of Assessment
Alternative Means Of Assessment: Alternative Means of Assessment refers to using different methods of evaluating a student's progress and skills, apart from traditional tests or exams. These alternative methods can include projects, portfolios, presentations, or oral assessments. The goal is to provide a more comprehensive and individualized way of assessing a student's learning and abilities, especially for students with disabilities or unique learning needs. By using alternative means of assessment, educators can better understand a student's strengths, challenges, and progress to develop more effective Individualized Education Programs (IEPs).
