# Eligible For Public Benefits (Medi-Cal)
Eligible For Public Benefits (Medi-Cal): When a child is eligible for public benefits such as Medi-Cal, it means that they qualify for government assistance programs based on factors like income, disability, or other criteria. Medi-Cal is California's Medicaid program that provides free or low-cost health coverage for eligible individuals and families. Being eligible for public benefits like Medi-Cal can affect an Individualized Education Program (IEP) by ensuring the child has access to necessary medical services, therapies, or supports that can help them succeed in school. It is important to disclose such benefits during IEP meetings to ensure the child receives appropriate educational services.
