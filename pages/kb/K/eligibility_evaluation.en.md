# Eligibility Evaluation
Eligibility Evaluation: An eligibility evaluation is a process used to determine if a student qualifies for special education services under an Individualized Education Program (IEP). This evaluation involves a comprehensive assessment of the student's academic, social, emotional, and behavioral needs to identify any disabilities that may impact their learning. The evaluation includes gathering information from parents, teachers, and other relevant professionals, as well as conducting tests and observations to determine the student's strengths and areas of need. The results of the evaluation help determine if the student meets the criteria for special education services and the development of an appropriate IEP.
