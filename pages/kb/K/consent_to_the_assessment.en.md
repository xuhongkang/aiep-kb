# Consent To The Assessment
Consent To The Assessment: Consent to the assessment refers to a parent or guardian giving permission for their child to be evaluated for special education services through various assessments such as testing, observations, and gathering of information. This consent is important for creating an Individualized Education Program (IEP) tailored to the child's specific needs. It allows the school to gather information about the child's strengths, weaknesses, and requirements for educational support.
