# Language/Speech Communication Development
Language/Speech Communication Development: Language/Speech Communication Development within an Individualized Education Program (IEP) focuses on improving a child's abilities to understand and use language effectively. It includes enhancing speech articulation, language comprehension, vocabulary, and communication skills. Goals in this area are tailored to meet the specific needs of the child, addressing issues such as speech delays, language disorders, or difficulties in social communication. Speech therapists play a crucial role in implementing strategies and interventions to support the child's communication development within the IEP.
