# Assessment Information To Be Considered By The Iep Team
Assessment Information To Be Considered By The Iep Team: Assessment information to be considered by the IEP team refers to the various evaluations and tests conducted to gather data about a student's strengths, challenges, and learning needs. This information helps in determining the student's eligibility for special education services and creating an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that is tailored to meet their specific requirements. These assessments can include academic assessments, cognitive assessments, standardized tests, observations, and input from teachers and parents. The IEP team uses this assessment data to set appropriate goals, determine necessary accommodations and modifications, and track the student's progress over time.
