# Post-Secondary Transition
Post-Secondary Transition: Post-Secondary Transition is the process of planning for a student's life after they finish high school. It involves setting goals for further education, employment, and independent living skills. The focus is on helping students with disabilities make a smooth transition from school to adult life. This may include exploring different career options, learning how to apply for jobs or colleges, understanding their rights, and accessing support services as needed.
