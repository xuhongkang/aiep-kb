# Motor Development
Motor Development: Motor development refers to the growth and coordination of the body's muscles and movements. It involves both fine motor skills (like writing and grasping objects) and gross motor skills (such as walking and running). Motor development is an important aspect of a child's overall development, impacting their physical abilities and coordination. Assessing motor development can help identify any delays or challenges a child may be facing and inform interventions and support strategies.
