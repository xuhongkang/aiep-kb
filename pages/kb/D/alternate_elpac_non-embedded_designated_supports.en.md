# Alternate Elpac Non-Embedded Designated Supports
Alternate Elpac Non-Embedded Designated Supports: Alternate ELPAC Non-embedded Designated Supports are specific accommodations provided to English learners with disabilities for the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) that are administered separately from the standard test format. These designated supports are intended to help students demonstrate their English language proficiency in a way that aligns with their individual needs and abilities. Examples of such supports include extended time, separate setting, and bilingual word-to-word glossaries. These accommodations are tailored to ensure that students can effectively showcase their language skills during assessments.
