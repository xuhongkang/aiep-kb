# Sbac With Accommodations Non-Embedded
Sbac With Accommodations Non-Embedded: SBAC stands for Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, which is a standardized test taken by students to assess their understanding of important subjects like math and English. Accommodations are special supports or adjustments provided to students with disabilities so they can participate in the test on a level playing field. Non-embedded accommodations are changes made to the testing environment or conditions that help students access the test content without changing the actual questions or tasks. These accommodations are typically determined by a student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) team to ensure fair and accurate assessment of the student's knowledge and skills.
