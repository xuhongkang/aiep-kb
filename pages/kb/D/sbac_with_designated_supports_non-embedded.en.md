# Sbac With Designated Supports Non-Embedded
Sbac With Designated Supports Non-Embedded: SBAC stands for Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, which is a standardized test that some students take as part of their academic evaluation. Designated supports for SBAC are accommodations given to students with disabilities or language barriers so they can better demonstrate their knowledge. Non-embedded supports are tools provided separately from the test itself, like a calculator or extra time. These supports are outlined in a student's IEP to ensure fair and equal testing conditions.
