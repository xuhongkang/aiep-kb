# Separate Setting
Separate Setting: Separate setting in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) refers to a learning environment where a student receives special education services away from their general education peers. This may include placements in self-contained classrooms, special schools, or separate facilities tailored to meet the unique needs of a student with disabilities. The decision to place a student in a separate setting is determined by the IEP team based on the individual needs of the student and the least restrictive environment that supports their education. The goal is to provide specialized support and accommodations to help the student succeed academically and socially.
