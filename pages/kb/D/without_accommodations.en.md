# Without Accommodations
Without Accommodations: Without accommodations refers to a situation where a student receiving an Individualized Education Program (IEP) does not require any special adjustments or modifications in the classroom environment or learning materials. This means the student can fully participate in classroom activities and demonstrate their abilities without any additional support. It signifies that the student can meet academic expectations and goals without the need for special accommodations. The absence of accommodations suggests that the student can learn and perform at the same level as their peers without any specific adaptations.
