# Alternate Elpac Embedded Designated Supports
Alternate Elpac Embedded Designated Supports: Alternate ELPAC Embedded Designated Supports are specialized tools or assistance provided to students with disabilities during the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) to help them access the test content. These supports are built into the test format itself to accommodate the individual needs of the students, such as having questions read aloud or providing additional response options. These supports are specifically designed to ensure that students with disabilities have equal opportunities to demonstrate their English language proficiency. The use of these supports is determined through the student's Individualized Education Program (IEP).
