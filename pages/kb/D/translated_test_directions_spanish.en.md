# Translated Test Directions Spanish
Translated Test Directions Spanish: Translated test directions in Spanish refer to the adaptation of test instructions from English to Spanish to ensure students who are bilingual or are English language learners can understand and effectively respond to assessment questions.

It aims to provide equal access to the assessment process and enable students to perform to the best of their abilities.
