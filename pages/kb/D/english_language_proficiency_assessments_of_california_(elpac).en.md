# English Language Proficiency Assessments Of California (Elpac)
English Language Proficiency Assessments Of California (Elpac): The English Language Proficiency Assessments of California (ELPAC) is a test given to students in California whose primary language is not English. It measures their proficiency in English language skills, such as listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The results help schools identify students who may need additional support with learning English. The ELPAC is used to determine a student's level of English proficiency and if they need English Language Development (ELD) services or support through an Individualized Education Program (IEP). By assessing students' language abilities, educators can provide appropriate instruction tailored to meet their needs.
