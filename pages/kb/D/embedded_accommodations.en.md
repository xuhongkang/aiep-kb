# Embedded Accommodations
Embedded Accommodations: Embedded accommodations are supports and modifications that are built into a student's everyday learning environment to help them succeed in school. These accommodations are part of the student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) and are tailored to their specific needs and learning style. Examples of embedded accommodations include extra time for assignments, preferential seating, visual aids, or modified assignments. These supports are provided to ensure that students can access and participate in the general education curriculum alongside their peers.
