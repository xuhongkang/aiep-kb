# Read Aloud
Read Aloud: Read Aloud is a common accommodation in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) where a student is provided with the opportunity to hear text read aloud instead of reading it themselves. This can be helpful for students who struggle with reading or have a disability that impacts their ability to decode text. By having the text read aloud, the student can better comprehend the content and participate more fully in classroom activities. The goal of Read Aloud accommodations is to support the student's access to the curriculum and promote their academic success.
