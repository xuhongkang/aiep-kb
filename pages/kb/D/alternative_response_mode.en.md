# Alternative Response Mode
Alternative Response Mode: An alternative response mode is a modification or accommodation in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that allows a student to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in a different way than traditional methods. This could include using assistive technology, verbal responses instead of written ones, or other supports that cater to the student's specific needs and abilities. By providing alternative response modes, educators can ensure that all students have equal opportunities to succeed in their learning and assessments.
