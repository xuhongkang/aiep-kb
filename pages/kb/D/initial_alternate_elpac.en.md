# Initial Alternate Elpac
Initial Alternate Elpac: Initial Alternate ELPAC stands for Initial Alternate English Language Proficiency Assessments for California. It is a test given to English learners with significant cognitive disabilities who are unable to take the standard English language proficiency test. This assessment is designed to measure the language proficiency levels of these students in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The results help educators determine the appropriate level of support and accommodations these students may need to access the curriculum effectively. The Initial Alternate ELPAC is an essential tool in ensuring that all students, including those with disabilities, receive the necessary support to succeed in their education.
