# Alternate Assessment(S)
Alternate Assessment(S): Alternate Assessments are tools used to evaluate the academic performance of students with special needs who are unable to participate in standardized assessments. These assessments are specifically designed to accommodate the student's unique learning style and abilities, providing a fair way to measure their progress and set appropriate educational goals. By utilizing Alternate Assessments, educators can ensure that the Individualized Education Program (IEP) accurately reflects the student's growth and identifies the necessary support and accommodations for their learning journey.
