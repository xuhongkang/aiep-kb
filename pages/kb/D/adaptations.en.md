# Adaptations
Adaptations: Adaptations in the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) refer to the changes made to the learning environment, teaching strategies, or materials to help students with disabilities succeed in school. These adaptations are tailored to meet the unique needs of each student and can include things like extended test-taking time, modified assignments, or assistive technology. By incorporating adaptations into an IEP, educators can ensure that students receive the support they need to access the curriculum and reach their full potential.
