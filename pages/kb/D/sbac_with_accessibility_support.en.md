# Sbac With Accessibility Support
Sbac With Accessibility Support: SBAC stands for Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, a group of states working together to develop tests that align with the Common Core State Standards. These tests are used to measure students' knowledge and skills in English language arts and math. SBAC with Accessibility Support means that students with disabilities or special needs are provided with accommodations during the test, such as extra time, a quiet testing environment, or access to assistive technology. These accommodations help ensure that all students, including those with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), have equal opportunities to demonstrate their abilities on the assessment.
