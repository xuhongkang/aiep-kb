# Noise Buffers
Noise Buffers: Noise buffers in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) refer to strategies or accommodations put in place to help a student who is sensitive to noise or easily distracted by background noise. These buffers can include things like noise-canceling headphones, preferential seating in the classroom away from noisy areas, or the use of white noise machines to help create a more conducive learning environment for the student. By minimizing distractions from noise, students can better focus on their work and learning tasks.
