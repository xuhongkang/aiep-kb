# Non-Embedded Designated Supports
Non-Embedded Designated Supports: Non-embedded Designated Supports are specific tools or services that are not regularly used in the classroom but are provided to a student with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to help them access learning material or demonstrate their understanding. These supports are tailored to the individual needs of the student and are put in place to ensure they have an equal opportunity to succeed academically. Examples of non-embedded designated supports can include assistive technology devices, extended time for tests, or the use of a scribe.
