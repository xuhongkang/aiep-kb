# Summative Elpac
Summative Elpac: The Summative ELPAC, or English Language Proficiency Assessments for California, is a test given to English learners in California schools to measure their English language proficiency. This assessment helps determine the progress of English learners in mastering the English language and meeting state standards. The test is taken annually by students until they are reclassified as proficient in English. The results of the Summative ELPAC help educators tailor instruction to meet the needs of English learners and track their language development over time.
