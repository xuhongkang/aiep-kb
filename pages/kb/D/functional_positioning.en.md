# Functional Positioning
Functional Positioning: Functional positioning is the way a student's body is positioned during daily activities to help them function at their best. It involves making sure the student is in a comfortable and supportive position to help them participate in tasks like eating, writing, and playing. Proper positioning can help improve a student's focus, comfort, and ability to engage in activities. It is important for students with disabilities to have appropriate functional positioning to support their learning and development.
