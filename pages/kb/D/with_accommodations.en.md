# With Accommodations
With Accommodations: With accommodations refers to the supports and adjustments made to help students with disabilities participate in educational activities on an equal basis with their peers. These accommodations may include changes in how a student learns, the way information is presented, or the environment in which tests are taken. Accommodations aim to level the playing field for students with disabilities, allowing them to showcase their abilities and reach their full potential in the classroom.
