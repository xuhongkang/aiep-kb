# Embedded Designated Supports
Embedded Designated Supports: Embedded designated supports are tools, resources, or strategies that are built into a student's daily instruction and assessment. These supports are specifically tailored to meet the individual needs of the student as outlined in their Individualized Education Program (IEP). They are integrated into the classroom environment to help students access the curriculum, participate in activities, and demonstrate their understanding. Examples of embedded designated supports include visual aids, manipulatives, graphic organizers, and technology tools. By incorporating these supports into everyday learning experiences, students can receive the assistance they need to succeed in the classroom.
