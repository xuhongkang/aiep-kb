# Non-Embedded Accommodations
Non-Embedded Accommodations: Non-embedded accommodations are supports or changes made to the learning environment that are provided outside of the regular classroom instruction. These accommodations are different from embedded supports that are seamlessly integrated into the classroom activities. Non-embedded accommodations could include modifications to testing conditions, additional time to complete assignments, or access to assistive technology. These accommodations aim to help students with disabilities access the curriculum and demonstrate their knowledge and skills. By providing non-embedded accommodations, educators can ensure that students receive the necessary support to achieve academic success.
