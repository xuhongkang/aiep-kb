# Translations (Spanish Stacked-Dual Language)
Translations (Spanish Stacked-Dual Language): Stacked-dual language programs, such as Spanish translations, involve teaching academic content in two languages, like English and Spanish, to help students become proficient in both languages. In this approach, students receive instruction in one language for part of the day and in another language for the rest. This helps students develop language skills in both languages while also learning essential academic concepts. Stacked-dual language programs aim to promote bilingualism and biliteracy among students, preparing them for success in a diverse and globalized world.
