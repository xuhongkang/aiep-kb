# Sbac With Designated Supports Embedded
Sbac With Designated Supports Embedded: The SBAC (Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium) with Designated Supports Embedded is a standardized test designed to measure students' progress in core subjects like math and English language arts. Designated supports are accommodations or tools that help students with disabilities or language barriers access the test content and demonstrate their knowledge effectively. By embedding these supports directly into the assessment, students can independently utilize them during testing, ensuring a fair and inclusive evaluation of their skills and abilities.
