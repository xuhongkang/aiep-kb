# English Language Arts
English Language Arts: English Language Arts (ELA) refers to the study of reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language skills. In school, ELA covers subjects like literature, grammar, vocabulary, writing, and communication. It helps students develop strong language skills that are essential for success in academics and beyond. ELA is an important part of a student's education as it not only teaches them how to effectively communicate but also nurtures their critical thinking abilities through the analysis and interpretation of texts.
