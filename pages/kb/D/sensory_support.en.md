# Sensory Support
Sensory Support: Sensory support in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) refers to accommodations and strategies that are put in place to help students who may struggle with processing sensory information. This can include sensory sensitivities or difficulties with sensory regulation. Examples of sensory supports could include providing noise-canceling headphones for students who are sensitive to loud noises, allowing sensory breaks during the day for students who need them, or providing fidget tools to help students focus. By incorporating sensory supports into an IEP, educators aim to create a learning environment that is more conducive to the needs of each individual student.
