# Alternate Elpac
Alternate Elpac: Alternate ELPAC stands for Alternate English Language Proficiency Assessments for California. It is designed for English learners with the most significant cognitive disabilities. This alternate assessment provides a way for these students to demonstrate their English language proficiency by using simplified language and modified test formats. This assessment helps educators understand the progress of students who may not be able to participate in the standard English proficiency test due to their disabilities.
