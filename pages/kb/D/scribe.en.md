# Scribe
Scribe: A scribe is someone who helps a student with writing tasks. In the context of an Individualized Education Program (IEP), a scribe can assist a student who struggles with writing due to a physical disability, learning disorder, or other challenges. The scribe can write down the student's thoughts or verbally dictated words, allowing the student to focus on the content without being hindered by writing difficulties. Having a scribe as part of an IEP can help the student better showcase their knowledge and abilities in various academic tasks.
