# Alternative Response Options
Alternative Response Options: Alternative response options are accommodations or modifications given to students with disabilities to help them participate in and complete assignments, tests, or assessments. These options may include providing extra time, allowing the use of assistive technology, or offering different ways for students to show their understanding, such as oral responses instead of written answers. These adjustments are put in place to ensure that all students have equal opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge and skills.
