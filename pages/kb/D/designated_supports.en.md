# Designated Supports
Designated Supports: Designated supports are specific tools, accommodations, or resources that are provided to students with disabilities to help them access the curriculum and demonstrate their knowledge and skills during assessments. These supports are outlined in the student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) and are tailored to meet the student's unique needs. Designated supports can include things like extra time on tests, assistive technology, visual aids, or a quiet testing environment. These supports are intended to level the playing field for students with disabilities and ensure that they have a fair opportunity to show what they know.
