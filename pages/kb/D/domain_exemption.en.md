# Domain Exemption
Domain Exemption: Domain exemption is a term used in Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) to refer to a situation where a student is excused from learning and being assessed in a particular subject area due to their current level of functioning or specific needs. This exemption allows the student to focus on other areas of education that are more essential for their growth and development. It is important for parents to understand the reasons behind a domain exemption and how it can benefit their child's educational progress.
