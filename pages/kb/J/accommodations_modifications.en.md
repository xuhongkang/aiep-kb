# Accommodations/Modifications
Accommodations/Modifications: Accommodations and modifications are changes in how a student learns or is tested to help them succeed in school. Accommodations are changes in how a student accesses information or demonstrates learning without changing the curriculum. For example, providing extra time for tests. Modifications are changes to what a student is expected to learn or how they are tested. For example, simplifying assignments. These changes are outlined in a student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) to support their unique needs and help them reach their academic goals.
