# Introductions
Introductions: In the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), 'Introductions' refer to the opening section of the document that provides details about the student, their background, and the purpose of the IEP. This section typically includes information such as the student's name, age, grade level, strengths, challenges, and any assessments or evaluations that have been conducted to determine their educational needs. The introduction sets the stage for the rest of the IEP by outlining the student's current educational situation and the goals that will be addressed through the plan.
