# Esy
Esy: ESY stands for Extended School Year, which refers to special education and related services provided to students with disabilities beyond the regular school year. ESY services are designed to prevent regression of skills and help students maintain the progress they made during the academic year. These services are considered when a student's IEP team determines that a break in programming would lead to significant skill loss, making it difficult to recoup those skills once school resumes. ESY can include a range of educational services such as tutoring, therapy, or other interventions based on the student's individual needs.
