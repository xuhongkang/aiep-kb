# Student'S Behavior Needs (Bip)
Student'S Behavior Needs (Bip): A Student's Behavior Needs refer to any specific challenges or issues a student may have related to their behavior that impact their learning and progress in school. To address these needs, schools may develop a Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP) as part of the student's Individualized Education Program (IEP). A BIP outlines strategies, supports, and interventions to help the student manage their behavior effectively in the school setting so they can succeed academically and socially. The goal of a BIP is to promote positive behavior and provide the student with the necessary tools and resources to thrive in a school environment.
