# Procedural Safeguards
Procedural Safeguards: Procedural Safeguards are a set of rules and protections put in place to ensure that students with disabilities and their parents are treated fairly in the special education process. These safeguards outline the rights of both the student and the parent, including the right to participate in the development of the Individualized Education Program (IEP), the right to review educational records, the right to request an evaluation for special education services, and the right to resolve disputes through mediation or a due process hearing. Procedural safeguards are mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to safeguard the educational rights of students with disabilities.
