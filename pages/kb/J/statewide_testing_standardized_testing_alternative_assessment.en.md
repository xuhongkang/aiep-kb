# Statewide Testing/Standardized Testing/Alternative Assessment
Statewide Testing/Standardized Testing/Alternative Assessment: Statewide testing, also known as standardized testing, is a method used to measure students' performance based on the same set of criteria across a state. These tests assess students' knowledge and skills in subjects like math, reading, and science. The results help educators identify areas where students may need additional support. In some cases, students with disabilities may take alternative assessments that are modified to suit their individual learning needs and abilities.
