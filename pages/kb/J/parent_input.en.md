# Parent Input
Parent Input: Parent input refers to the valuable thoughts, concerns, and insights that parents are encouraged to share about their child's education and unique needs when creating an Individualized Education Program (IEP). Parents play a crucial role in the IEP process by providing information about their child's strengths, challenges, preferences, and goals. Their input helps ensure that the IEP team, which includes parents, teachers, and school professionals, develops a comprehensive plan tailored to meet the specific needs of the student. Through open communication and collaboration, parents can contribute to the creation of an effective and personalized IEP for their child.
