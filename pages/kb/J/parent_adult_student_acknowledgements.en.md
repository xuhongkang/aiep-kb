# Parent/Adult Student Acknowledgements
Parent/Adult Student Acknowledgements: Parent/Adult Student Acknowledgements in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) refer to the formal recognition and agreement by parents or adult students of the proposed educational plan for a child with special needs. These acknowledgements typically cover aspects such as understanding the goals, services, accommodations, and modifications outlined in the IEP, as well as agreeing to actively participate in the implementation and review of the plan. By signing the acknowledgements, parents or adult students indicate their commitment to supporting their child's educational progress and working collaboratively with the school to ensure the IEP's effectiveness.
