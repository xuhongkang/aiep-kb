# Administrator
Administrator: An administrator in the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) is typically a school official responsible for overseeing the special education services provided to students with disabilities. Administrators work closely with teachers, parents, and other professionals to develop, implement, and monitor IEPs. They ensure that the IEP goals are being met, review progress reports, address any issues that arise, and make decisions about necessary accommodations or modifications to support the student's learning and development. Administrators play a crucial role in advocating for the student's best interests and promoting their educational success.
