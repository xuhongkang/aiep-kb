# Assistive Technology
Assistive Technology: Assistive Technology (AT) refers to devices, software, or equipment that help individuals with disabilities to improve their abilities and perform tasks. AT can range from simple tools like pencil grips to complex systems like speech-to-text software or communication devices. These technologies are customized to meet the specific needs of the individual and can aid in communication, learning, mobility, or daily activities. In the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), AT is often included as a support service to help students with disabilities access their education and participate in classroom activities alongside their peers.
