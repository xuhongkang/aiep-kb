# Decline Of Services
Decline Of Services: Decline of services refers to a situation where a student's special education services are reduced or taken away over time, often due to the student's improved academic performance or ability to function in a general education setting. This is part of the ongoing review process of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to ensure that the services provided are tailored to the student's current needs and abilities. It is important for parents to stay involved in these reviews to advocate for their child's continued support.
