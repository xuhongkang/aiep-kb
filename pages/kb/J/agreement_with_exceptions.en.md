# Agreement With Exceptions
Agreement With Exceptions: An agreement with exceptions in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) refers to a situation where the IEP team, including parents, educators, and other specialists, agrees on the majority of the components of the IEP but there are specific areas where there is a disagreement. These exceptions are documented in the IEP to ensure clarity about the areas of disagreement and to outline how they will be addressed or resolved. It is important for all parties to work collaboratively to find common ground and reach a consensus on the IEP goals, services, and accommodations for the benefit of the student's education and growth.
