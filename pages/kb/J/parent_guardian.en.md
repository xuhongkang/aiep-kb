# Parent/Guardian
Parent/Guardian: A parent/guardian is someone who has legal responsibility for a child and makes decisions on their behalf. In the context of an Individualized Education Program (IEP), the parent/guardian plays a crucial role in the development and implementation of the plan. They are essential members of the IEP team, along with educators and other professionals, and are actively involved in making decisions about their child's education, goals, services, and accommodations. Parent/guardian input is valuable for creating an IEP that meets the unique needs of the child and ensures they receive the support necessary to succeed in school.
