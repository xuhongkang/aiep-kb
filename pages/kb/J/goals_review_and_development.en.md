# Goals Review And Development
Goals Review And Development: Goals Review and Development is a process in the Individualized Education Program (IEP) where educators and parents assess the progress of a student in achieving their set goals and plan new objectives. This involves looking at the child's strengths, challenges, and current performance to adjust the goals to meet their individual needs and help them succeed in school. It is an essential part of the IEP process to ensure that the student is receiving appropriate support and resources tailored to their learning abilities.
