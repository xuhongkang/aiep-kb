# Educational Team Inputs
Educational Team Inputs: Educational Team Inputs refer to the information, feedback, and recommendations provided by various individuals involved in a student's education. This can include teachers, special education staff, therapists, parents, and the student themselves. These inputs are valuable in creating an effective Individualized Education Program (IEP) tailored to the student's unique needs and goals. By considering the perspectives and expertise of each team member, the IEP can address academic, behavioral, and social-emotional aspects of the student's learning experience.
