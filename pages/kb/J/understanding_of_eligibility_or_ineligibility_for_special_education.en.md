# Understanding Of Eligibility Or Ineligibility For Special Education
Understanding Of Eligibility Or Ineligibility For Special Education: Understanding eligibility or ineligibility for special education involves a process where a student is assessed to determine if they have a disability that significantly impacts their ability to learn and require individualized support to succeed in school. Eligibility is determined by a comprehensive evaluation that looks at the student's needs and educational performance. If a student meets the criteria outlined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), they are considered eligible for special education services. If a student does not meet these criteria, they may be found ineligible for special education but may still receive support through other educational programs.
