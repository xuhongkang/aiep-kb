# Participants
Participants: Participants in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) refer to the people involved in the planning and implementation of a child's special education services. This typically includes the parents or guardians, teachers, special education professionals, school administrators, and sometimes the student themselves. Each participant plays a crucial role in developing, reviewing, and updating the IEP to ensure that the child's unique educational needs are being met effectively. Collaboration among participants is essential for the success of an IEP.
