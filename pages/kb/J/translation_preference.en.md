# Translation Preference
Translation Preference: Translation preference is a term used in Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) to refer to the language in which parents or guardians prefer to receive important information about their child's education and IEP. It ensures that communication between the school and the parents is clear and effective. By understanding the translation preference of parents, schools can provide documents, reports, and meetings in the preferred language, helping parents to actively participate in their child's education.
