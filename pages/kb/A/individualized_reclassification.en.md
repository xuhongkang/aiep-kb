# Individualized Reclassification
Individualized Reclassification: Individualized reclassification is a process within an Individualized Education Program (IEP) where a student's progress and needs are reevaluated to determine if changes are needed to their educational plan. This reevaluation ensures that the student is receiving the appropriate support and services to help them succeed academically. It may involve updating goals, accommodations, or services provided to the student based on their current needs and progress. Individualized reclassification aims to tailor the education plan to the specific needs of the student, ensuring they receive the best possible support to reach their academic goals.
