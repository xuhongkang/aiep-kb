# Date Of Initial Referral For Special Education Services
Date Of Initial Referral For Special Education Services: The Date of Initial Referral for Special Education Services refers to the date when a student is first referred for evaluation to determine if they are eligible for special education services. This referral can come from a teacher, parent, or other school staff if they suspect the student may have a disability that impacts their learning. Once the referral is made, the evaluation process begins to assess the student's strengths and needs to determine if they qualify for an Individualized Education Program (IEP). This date is crucial as it sets the timeline for the evaluation and IEP development process.
