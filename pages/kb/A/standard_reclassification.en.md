# Standard Reclassification
Standard Reclassification: Standard reclassification is a process in education where a student, who was previously identified as needing special education services through an Individualized Education Program (IEP), meets the criteria to no longer require those services. This usually involves a thorough evaluation of the student's progress and skills to determine if they have made enough improvement to function well without specific accommodations or modifications. Standard reclassification shows that the student has successfully caught up with their peers and can now learn effectively in a general education setting.
