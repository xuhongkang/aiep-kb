# Race
Race: Race refers to a person's physical characteristics, such as skin color, hair texture, and facial features, that are often used to categorize groups of people. Race is not based on biological differences, but is a social construct that has been used to divide people. Understanding race is important in education to ensure that all students are treated fairly and have access to the resources they need to succeed.
