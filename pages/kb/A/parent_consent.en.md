# Parent Consent
Parent Consent: Parent consent refers to the agreement given by a parent or guardian for their child to receive special education services through an Individualized Education Program (IEP). It is important for parents to provide consent for evaluations, development of the IEP, and any changes made to the IEP. This ensures that parents are actively involved in the decision-making process regarding their child's education and support needs.
