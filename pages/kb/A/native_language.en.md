# Native Language
Native Language: Native language refers to the language a person has acquired from birth or a very young age and has the most proficiency in. In the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), considering a student's native language is crucial for providing appropriate educational support and ensuring effective communication between the student, their parents, and educators. It is important for educators to understand a student's native language proficiency to tailor instruction, accommodations, and services that cater to their unique language needs.
