# General Curriculum
General Curriculum: The general curriculum refers to the standard academic content that all students are expected to learn at each grade level. It includes subjects like math, science, English language arts, and social studies. When developing an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for a student with special needs, the general curriculum is an important consideration. The IEP team determines how the student will access and make progress in the general curriculum, often through accommodations, modifications, specialized instruction, and related services. The goal is to ensure that the student has meaningful access to the same educational content as their peers, tailored to their unique learning needs.
