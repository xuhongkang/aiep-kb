# Parent Or Legal Guardian
Parent Or Legal Guardian: A parent or legal guardian is someone who has the legal responsibility for a child and can make decisions on their behalf. In the context of an Individualized Education Program (IEP), the parent or legal guardian plays a crucial role in the planning and implementation of the program. They are key members of the IEP team, along with teachers and other professionals, and provide important input about the child's strengths, needs, and goals. The parent or legal guardian also has the right to participate in IEP meetings, review and approve the plan, and make sure their child receives the support and services outlined in the IEP.
