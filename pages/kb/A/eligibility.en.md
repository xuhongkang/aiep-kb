# Eligibility
Eligibility: Eligibility refers to meeting the criteria that qualify a student for special education services through an Individualized Education Program (IEP). This process involves assessments and evaluations to determine if a student has a disability that affects their ability to learn and requires specialized instruction and support. Eligibility is determined by a team of professionals, including parents, teachers, and specialists, based on the student's needs and the impact of the disability on their education. Once eligibility is established, an IEP is developed to outline the specific services and supports the student will receive.
