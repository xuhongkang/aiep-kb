# Meeting Type (Initial, Annual, Triennial, Additional)
Meeting Type (Initial, Annual, Triennial, Additional): Meeting Type refers to the different types of Individualized Education Program (IEP) meetings that occur throughout a student's education journey. An Initial meeting is the first meeting held to develop the IEP for a student with special needs, while the Annual meeting takes place once a year to review and update the current IEP. A Triennial meeting occurs every three years to evaluate the student's progress and determine if any changes are needed to the IEP. Additional meetings can be scheduled as needed to address specific concerns or changes in the student's educational needs.
