# Primary And Secondary Disabilities
Primary And Secondary Disabilities: Primary and secondary disabilities are terms used in the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) to describe the different types of disabilities a student may have. The primary disability is the main condition that qualifies a student for special education services and drives the development of their IEP. It is the most significant impairment affecting the student's ability to learn and access the curriculum. Secondary disabilities are additional challenges or conditions that may impact the student's learning or behavior, but they are not the primary reason for the student's eligibility for special education services. These secondary disabilities may still be included in the IEP to provide appropriate support and accommodations for the student's overall well-being and academic success.
