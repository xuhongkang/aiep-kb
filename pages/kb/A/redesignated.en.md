# Redesignated
Redesignated: Redesignated refers to a student who was previously identified as having special education needs, such as a learning disability, but has demonstrated significant progress and no longer requires special education services. This process involves a team of professionals, including parents, teachers, and specialists, reviewing the student's progress and determining that the student can succeed in a general education setting without additional support.
