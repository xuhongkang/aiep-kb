# Referral For Special Education Service
Referral For Special Education Service: A referral for special education service is a formal request made by a teacher or parent to evaluate a student who may be struggling in school. This process is initiated when a student's academic performance or behavior indicates a need for additional support beyond what is provided in the general education setting. The referral triggers an assessment to determine if the student qualifies for an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to address their specific learning needs. The evaluation may include psychological testing, educational assessments, and observations to determine the best course of action to help the student succeed in school.
