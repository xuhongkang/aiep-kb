# Transition Services
Transition Services: Transition services are a key part of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for students with disabilities who are nearing the end of their high school years. These services help students smoothly move from school to post-school activities like further education, job training, employment, independent living, and community participation. Transition services are personalized based on each student's needs, interests, and goals, and are designed to prepare them for life after high school.
