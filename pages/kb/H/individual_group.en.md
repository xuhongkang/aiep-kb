# Individual/Group
Individual/Group: Individual/Group refers to the setting in which a student with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) receives their special education services. The term 'individual' means the student receives services one-on-one, tailored specifically to their unique needs. On the other hand, 'group' setting involves services provided to a small group of students with similar needs. The decision on the setting depends on the student's IEP team, considering what will best support the student's learning and progress.
