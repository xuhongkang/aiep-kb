# Service Delivery Method(S)
Service Delivery Method(S): Service delivery methods refer to the ways in which special education services are provided to students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). These methods can include services delivered in a general education classroom, pull-out services where the student leaves the classroom for specialized instruction, or a combination of both. The specific service delivery method chosen for a student is based on their unique needs and goals outlined in their IEP.
