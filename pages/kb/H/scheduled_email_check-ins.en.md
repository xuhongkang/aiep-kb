# Scheduled Email Check-Ins
Scheduled Email Check-Ins: Scheduled email check-ins refer to a predetermined plan where educators or support staff engage in regular communication with parents or caregivers via email on a scheduled basis. These check-ins are meant to provide updates on a student's progress, address any concerns, share information about upcoming events or resources, and maintain open lines of communication between school and home. By having set times for these email exchanges, it helps ensure consistent and timely communication, fostering collaboration in supporting the student's educational needs.
