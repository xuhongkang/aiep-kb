# Frequency & Duration
Frequency & Duration: Frequency refers to how often a service or support is provided to a student with an Individualized Education Program (IEP). Duration is the length of time each session of the service or support lasts. These two factors are important components of an IEP as they outline the specific details of how and when the student will receive the necessary accommodations and services to support their learning and development. By clearly defining the frequency and duration of services in the IEP, educators and other support staff can ensure that the student's needs are consistently met in a structured and effective manner.
