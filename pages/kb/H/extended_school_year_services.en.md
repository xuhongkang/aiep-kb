# Extended School Year Services
Extended School Year Services: Extended School Year (ESY) services are special education and related services that are provided to students with disabilities beyond the regular school year. These services are offered when it is determined that a student is at risk of losing critical skills or regression over extended breaks, such as summer vacation. ESY services are individualized to meet the unique needs of each student and may include academic support, therapy, social skills training, and other interventions. The goal of ESY services is to prevent the loss of skills and help students maintain their progress in achieving their educational goals.
