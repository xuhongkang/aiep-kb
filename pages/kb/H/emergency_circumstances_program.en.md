# Emergency Circumstances Program
Emergency Circumstances Program: The Emergency Circumstances Program is a special provision within an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that provides support and accommodations for students facing unforeseen challenges or crises that may impact their ability to receive an education. This program allows for temporary adjustments to the student's learning environment, services, or goals to address the immediate needs arising from the emergency situation. It aims to ensure that students can continue to access a free and appropriate public education despite the challenges they are facing.
