# Instruction, Services, Or Both
Instruction, Services, Or Both: Instruction refers to the teaching and guidance given to a student to help them learn. Services are additional supports provided to students to help them access their education, such as speech therapy, counseling, or physical therapy. In the context of an Individualized Education Program (IEP), both instruction and services are outlined to meet the specific needs of a student with disabilities. Instruction includes how the student will be taught and what materials will be used, while services provide extra help to support the student's learning and development.
