# Service Delivery Methods
Service Delivery Methods: Service delivery methods refer to the specific ways in which special education services and supports outlined in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) are provided to students. These methods can include services delivered in a variety of settings such as in the general education classroom, in a resource room, through pull-out sessions, or through one-on-one instruction with a specialist. The choice of service delivery method is based on the individual needs of the student as identified in their IEP to ensure they receive the support necessary to access and make progress in their education.
