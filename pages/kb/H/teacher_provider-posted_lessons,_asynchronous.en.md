# Teacher/Provider-Posted Lessons, Asynchronous
Teacher/Provider-Posted Lessons, Asynchronous: Teacher/provider-posted lessons refer to educational materials and resources that are created and shared by teachers or providers to support students' learning outside of traditional classroom settings. These lessons can be accessed by students at any time, allowing them to learn at their own pace. Asynchronous means that the learning activities do not have to occur in real-time, offering flexibility for students to engage with the content when it is convenient for them.
