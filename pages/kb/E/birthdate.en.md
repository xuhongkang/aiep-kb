# Birthdate
Birthdate: A birthdate is the date on which a person is born. It is an essential piece of information used to identify individuals and keep track of important milestones in their lives. In the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), a student's birthdate is a crucial piece of data used to ensure their educational needs are met at the appropriate developmental stage. It helps in determining eligibility for special education services and planning interventions that are tailored to the student's age and individual requirements.
