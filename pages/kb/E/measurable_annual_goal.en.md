# Measurable Annual Goal
Measurable Annual Goal: A Measurable Annual Goal in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a specific objective that a student with special needs is expected to achieve within a year. These goals should be clear, achievable, and measurable so that progress can be tracked and interventions can be adjusted as needed. They are tailored to the unique needs of the student and are a critical component of the IEP to ensure that the student receives appropriate support and services to succeed in school.
