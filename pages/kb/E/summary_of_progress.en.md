# Summary Of Progress
Summary Of Progress: A Summary of Progress is a report that outlines a student's growth and development in specific areas as documented in their Individualized Education Program (IEP). It provides a snapshot of the student's achievements, challenges, and goals over a defined period. The report may include information on academic performance, social skills, behavior, and any modifications or accommodations that have been implemented to support the student's learning. The Summary of Progress helps teachers, parents, and other stakeholders track the student's progress and make informed decisions about their educational needs.
