Addresses Other Educational Needs: When an Individualized Education Program (IEP) addresses other educational needs, it means that the plan includes specific strategies and supports to help a student with various aspects of their learning beyond academics.

By addressing these additional needs in the IEP, educators aim to provide a comprehensive and tailored approach to support the student in all areas of their education.
