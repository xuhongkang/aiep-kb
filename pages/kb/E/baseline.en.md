# Baseline
Baseline: A baseline in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a starting point that helps educators measure a student's progress. It is the initial assessment of a student's skills, abilities, and performance in a specific area before any instructional interventions or support are put in place. By establishing a baseline, teachers can accurately evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies and accommodations outlined in the IEP.
