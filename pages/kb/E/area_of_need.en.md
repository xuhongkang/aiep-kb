# Area Of Need
Area Of Need: Areas of need refer to specific areas where a student requires support or improvement in order to succeed academically and function effectively. These areas could include academic subjects like math or reading, social skills, behavioral issues, communication, motor skills, or any other aspect essential for learning and participation in school. Identifying and addressing these areas of need is a critical part of developing an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to ensure that a student receives the necessary assistance and accommodations to reach their full potential.
