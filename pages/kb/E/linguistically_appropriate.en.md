# Linguistically Appropriate
Linguistically Appropriate: Being linguistically appropriate in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) means that the plan is designed specifically to meet the unique needs of students who speak languages other than English or have communication challenges. It ensures that the IEP goals, accommodations, and services are tailored to the student's language abilities and communication skills, so they can fully participate in their education. This includes providing interpreters, translated materials, and culturally relevant support for families.
