# Progress Report
Progress Report: A progress report is a document that provides updates on a student's academic and developmental progress towards their Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals. These reports often include information on the student's strengths, areas for improvement, and overall progress in various subjects or skills. Progress reports are typically shared with parents and caregivers on a regular basis to keep them informed about their child's educational journey and to discuss any necessary adjustments to the IEP to support the student's success.
