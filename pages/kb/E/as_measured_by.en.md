# As Measured By
As Measured By: The term 'as measured by' in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) refers to the specific criteria or standards used to assess a student's progress towards their educational goals. These measurements help track the child's development and determine if the strategies outlined in the IEP are effective in meeting their needs. By setting measurable benchmarks, educators and parents can evaluate the student's growth and make adjustments to the IEP as needed to ensure continued progress.
