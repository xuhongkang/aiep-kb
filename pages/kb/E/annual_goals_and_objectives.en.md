# Annual Goals And Objectives
Annual Goals And Objectives: Annual Goals and Objectives are specific targets set for a student in the Individualized Education Program (IEP) to work on over the course of a year. These goals are tailored to the student's needs and abilities and help measure progress in areas like academics, behavior, communication, and other skills. Objectives are smaller steps that lead to achieving the overall goal. They are designed to be achievable within a year and are reviewed regularly to track the student's development.
