# Short-Term Objective
Short-Term Objective: Short-term objectives are specific, measurable goals that a student with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) should achieve within a short period, usually within a year. These objectives break down the larger goals outlined in the IEP into smaller, manageable steps. They help track the student's progress and provide a clear roadmap for monitoring and assessing their development. Short-term objectives are customized to meet the unique needs and abilities of the student, ensuring that they make meaningful progress towards their educational targets.
