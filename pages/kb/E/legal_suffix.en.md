# Legal Suffix
Legal Suffix: A legal suffix is a title added to a person's name according to their legal status, such as Jr., Sr., Esq., or Ph.D. These suffixes provide specific information about an individual, like a generational difference or professional qualification. While these titles can hold personal significance, they are usually not necessary for official identification purposes.
