# Goal: Annual Review
Goal: Annual Review: An annual review is a meeting held once a year to discuss your child's Individualized Education Program (IEP). During the annual review, the IEP team, which includes you as a parent, teachers, and other school staff, evaluates your child's progress towards their goals and determines if any changes are needed for the upcoming year. This meeting is crucial for ensuring your child is receiving the support they need to succeed in school.
