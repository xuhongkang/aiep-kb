# Student Legal Name
Student Legal Name: A student's legal name is their official name that is recognized by the government and used for legal documents and identification purposes. It is important to accurately provide a student's legal name on educational records, including their Individualized Education Program (IEP). The legal name ensures consistency and accuracy in documentation, preventing any potential issues or confusion regarding the identity of the student. When creating an IEP, the student's legal name should be used to maintain clarity and compliance with legal requirements.
