# Comments
Comments: Comments on an Individualized Education Program (IEP) are notes or feedback provided by teachers, parents, or other professionals involved in a student's education. These comments can reflect on a student's progress towards IEP goals, behavior in the classroom, areas where the student may need additional support, or successes that have been achieved. Communicating through comments ensures that all team members are informed about the student's development and can collaborate effectively to meet their individualized needs outlined in the IEP.
