# Transition Goal: Education, Training, Employment, Independent Living
Transition Goal: Education, Training, Employment, Independent Living: Transition goals are a crucial part of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that help students prepare for life after high school. These goals focus on education, training, employment, and independent living skills.
