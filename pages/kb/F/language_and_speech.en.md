# Language And Speech
Language And Speech: Language and speech are important components of an Individualized Education Program (IEP). Language refers to the way we communicate using words, while speech involves the physical production of sounds to form words and sentences. In an IEP, language and speech goals are personalized based on the individual student's needs and abilities. These goals may include improving vocabulary, grammar, articulation, fluency, and comprehension skills. Speech therapists, also known as speech-language pathologists, play a key role in helping students achieve their language and speech goals outlined in their IEPs.
