# Specialized Academic Instruction
Specialized Academic Instruction: Specialized Academic Instruction (SAI) is a key component of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for students with disabilities. SAI involves tailoring teaching strategies, materials, and methods to meet the unique learning needs of the student. It aims to support students in making progress in the general education curriculum by providing targeted instruction in specific skill areas. SAI may be delivered in a variety of settings, including in the general education classroom, small groups, or one-on-one sessions, to help students succeed academically.
