# Program Modifications
Program Modifications: Program modifications are changes made to the curriculum or learning environment to help a student with unique needs succeed in school. These modifications can include adjustments to the way a subject is taught, the amount or complexity of work given to the student, or the way a student's progress is assessed. These changes are tailored to meet the specific needs of the student and are outlined in their Individualized Education Program (IEP). By incorporating program modifications, educators can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for students with diverse learning needs.
