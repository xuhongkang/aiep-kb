# Extended School Year (Esy)
Extended School Year (Esy): Extended School Year (ESY) is a term used in special education to refer to additional educational services provided to students with disabilities over the traditional school breaks like summer vacation. This extra support helps these students maintain the skills they have learned during the school year and prevent regression. ESY services are determined on an individual basis through the student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) based on their unique needs and progress. The goal of ESY is to ensure that students with disabilities receive continuous support and do not experience significant learning setbacks during extended breaks from school.
