Service Options Considered By The Iep Team: Service options considered by the IEP team are the different types of support and accommodations that can be provided to a student with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to help them succeed academically and in other areas.

The IEP team, which includes parents, teachers, and other school staff, work together to determine what services will best meet the individual needs of the student.
