# Duration/Frequency
Duration/Frequency: Duration refers to the length of time a service or support will be provided in an Individualized Education Program (IEP). Frequency indicates how often the service or support will be provided. These details are included in the IEP to ensure that the student receives the necessary and appropriate assistance to make educational progress. The duration/frequency section of the IEP may specify the number of sessions per week, the length of each session, or the total duration of the service throughout the school year.
