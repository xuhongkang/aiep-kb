# End Date
End Date: The end date in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) refers to the anticipated date when the goals and objectives outlined in the IEP are expected to be achieved. This date is set by the IEP team based on the specific needs of the student and the progress made towards meeting those goals. The end date helps track the effectiveness of the IEP and provides a timeline for reviewing and revising the student's educational plan. It may be adjusted based on the student's progress, any changes in their needs, or other factors that impact their education.
