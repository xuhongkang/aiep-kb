# Start Date
Start Date: The start date in the context of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) refers to the date when the plan officially goes into effect. This is the day from which the goals and services outlined in the IEP begin to be implemented to support the student's education. The start date is an important detail as it marks the beginning of the IEP's term and indicates when the school and all involved parties are expected to start providing the necessary accommodations and support for the student's learning.
