# Totaling
Totaling: Totaling in the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) refers to the process of combining all the data and information collected during evaluations, assessments, goal setting, and progress monitoring to create a comprehensive and detailed plan for a student with special needs. This involves adding up the necessary components such as present levels of performance, annual goals, accommodations, modifications, and any additional supports required to meet the student's unique educational needs. The totaling process ensures that all aspects of the IEP work together cohesively to provide a tailored educational program for the student.
