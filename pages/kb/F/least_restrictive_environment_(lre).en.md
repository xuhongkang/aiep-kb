# Least Restrictive Environment (Lre)
Least Restrictive Environment (Lre): The term Least Restrictive Environment, often referred to as LRE, is a key principle in special education that aims to provide students with disabilities the opportunity to learn alongside their non-disabled peers to the maximum extent possible. This means that a student with special needs should be educated in a general education classroom with appropriate aids and supports, rather than being isolated or segregated in a separate special education setting. The goal is to ensure that students with disabilities are included in the same activities and settings as their peers without disabilities to promote socialization, academic growth, and overall well-being.
