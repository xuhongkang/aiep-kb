# Communicate Effectively on Time

Ongoing communication with the case manager about student progress and having a calendar that shows the student schedule, good case managers will create a weekly schedule that shows when the student is receiving their special ed services, how much time, if it is on a 1-1 or if it is in a group etc. In an ideal world all teachers/case managers should provide this, but many of them donâ€™t. Having a clear schedule makes it easier for parents to understand about the services provided to their students.
