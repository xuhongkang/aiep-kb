# Statewide Assessments
Statewide Assessments: Statewide assessments are tests that are administered to students in a particular state to evaluate their academic progress and proficiency in key subjects such as math, reading, and science. These assessments are used to measure student achievement, identify areas for improvement, and ensure that schools are meeting educational standards set by the state. Results from statewide assessments can also help teachers and schools tailor instruction and support for students who may need additional help in specific areas.
