# Fine Motor And Visual Motor Integration
Fine Motor And Visual Motor Integration: Fine motor skills involve the coordination of small muscles in movements like writing, cutting with scissors, or manipulating small objects. Visual motor integration is the ability to coordinate what the eyes see with the body's movements. It's important for tasks like reading, writing, and playing sports. Both fine motor and visual motor integration skills are essential for daily activities and academic success. Children with challenges in these areas may need support and accommodations in their Individualized Education Program (IEP) to help them improve and succeed.
