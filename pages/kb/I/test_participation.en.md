# Test Participation
Test Participation: Test participation in the context of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) refers to how a student with special educational needs takes part in assessments and standardized tests. The IEP team discusses and decides whether the student will participate in these tests with or without accommodations or modifications based on their unique needs. The goal is to ensure the assessment accurately reflects the student's abilities and progress. Test participation is important to evaluate the student's academic growth, determine the effectiveness of the IEP, and provide necessary support for their learning journey.
