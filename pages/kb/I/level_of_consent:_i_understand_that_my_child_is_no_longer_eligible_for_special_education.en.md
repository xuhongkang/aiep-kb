# Level Of Consent: I Understand That My Child Is No Longer Eligible For Special Education
Level Of Consent: I Understand That My Child Is No Longer Eligible For Special Education: Level of consent refers to the parent's agreement or permission for the various components included in their child's Individualized Education Program (IEP). This agreement is crucial in determining the strategies, goals, and services that will be provided to support the child's learning needs. Parents play a vital role in the IEP process, and their consent is typically required before any changes or evaluations can be made to the plan. Parents should be actively involved in understanding and providing consent to ensure that the IEP reflects the best support for their child's education.
