# Behavior Impedes Learning
Behavior Impedes Learning: Behavior Impedes Learning is a term used in Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) to describe when a student's behavior hinders their ability to participate in educational activities or benefit from instruction. This could include behaviors such as disruptions, defiance, or aggression that interfere with the student's learning or the learning of others in the classroom. Teachers and school staff work with parents and students to address these behaviors through strategies and supports outlined in the student's IEP to help create a more conducive learning environment.
