# Level Of Consent: I Understand That My Child Is Not Eligible For Special Education
Level Of Consent: I Understand That My Child Is Not Eligible For Special Education: The level of consent refers to the permission or agreement given by parents or legal guardians for the evaluation and placement of their child in special education programs. If a child is found eligible for special education services, parents must provide consent for the development and implementation of an Individualized Education Program (IEP). Without parental consent, the school cannot move forward with any special education services or placements.
