# Signature
Signature: A signature on an Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a parent's or guardian's way of giving their consent to the plan that has been developed for their child with special needs. By signing the IEP, the parent acknowledges that they agree with the goals, objectives, and services outlined in the plan. This signature also indicates that the parent was actively involved in the IEP process, including attending meetings, providing input, and collaborating with the school team to create a program tailored to their child's unique needs.
