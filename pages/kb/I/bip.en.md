# Bip
Bip: BIP stands for Behavior Intervention Plan, which is a part of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for students with behavior challenges. The BIP outlines strategies and interventions to address problem behaviors and promote positive behavior in the classroom. It is tailored to the specific needs of the student and may include goals, triggers for behaviors, types of interventions, and ways to measure progress. The BIP is developed by a team that may include teachers, parents, and other professionals, and is regularly reviewed and updated to ensure its effectiveness.
