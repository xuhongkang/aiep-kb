# Expressive Communication
Expressive Communication: Expressive communication refers to the ability to convey thoughts, feelings, or ideas through speech, writing, signing, or gestures. In the context of an Individualized Education Program (IEP), expressive communication goals may focus on improving a student's ability to articulate their thoughts clearly, use appropriate language and vocabulary, and effectively communicate with others. These goals are tailored to meet the specific needs of the student and may involve strategies such as speech therapy, augmentative and alternative communication systems, or social skills training.
