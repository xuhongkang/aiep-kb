# Anticipated Completion Date
Anticipated Completion Date: The Anticipated Completion Date is the estimated date when a particular goal or objective in a student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) is expected to be achieved. It is an approximate timeline set by the IEP team based on the student's current abilities, progress, and the supports and services provided. This date helps track the student's advancement and allows for periodic reviews and adjustments to the IEP as needed to ensure the student is making meaningful progress towards their educational goals.
