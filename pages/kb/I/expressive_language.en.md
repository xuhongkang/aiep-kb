# Expressive Language
Expressive Language: Expressive language refers to the ability to express thoughts and ideas using words, gestures, and facial expressions. It involves using words and sentences to communicate with others. In the context of an Individualized Education Program (IEP), goals related to expressive language may focus on improving vocabulary, sentence formation, and overall communication skills. Therapists, teachers, and parents work together to develop strategies and activities to support a student's expressive language development.
