# Level Of Consent: I Decline The Offer Of Initiation Of Special Education Services
Level Of Consent: I Decline The Offer Of Initiation Of Special Education Services: Level of consent refers to the option for parents or guardians to either agree or decline the initiation of special education services for their child. In the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), when a child is being considered for special education services, parents are given the opportunity to provide consent for the evaluation and development of an IEP. If parents decline the offer of special education services, the school cannot move forward with providing those services without the parents' agreement. This choice empowers parents to make decisions about their child's education and ensures that services are provided with their informed consent.
