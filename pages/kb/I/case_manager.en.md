# Case Manager
Case Manager: A case manager in the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) is a key team member who oversees the implementation of a student's IEP. They are responsible for coordinating assessments, developing the IEP, ensuring services are provided as outlined in the plan, and monitoring the student's progress. Case managers act as a central point of contact for parents, teachers, and other professionals involved in the student's education, facilitating communication and collaboration among the team. They play a crucial role in advocating for the student's needs and ensuring that the IEP is being effectively implemented to support the student's educational goals.
