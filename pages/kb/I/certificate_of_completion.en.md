# Certificate Of Completion
Certificate Of Completion: A Certificate of Completion is a document awarded to a student who has completed their individualized education program (IEP) requirements but has not met the same academic standards as their peers to receive a high school diploma. This certificate acknowledges the student's hard work and progress in their educational journey. It does not count as a high school diploma, but it does show that the student has participated in and benefited from special education services. This certificate can be a stepping stone towards employment, further education, or independent living.
