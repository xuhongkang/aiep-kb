# Supplementary Aids & Services And Other Supports
Supplementary Aids & Services And Other Supports: Supplementary aids & services and other supports are extra resources and assistance that can help a student with special needs succeed in school. These can include things like note-taking assistance, specialized instruction, technology devices, or even preferential seating in the classroom. These supports are customized to meet the unique needs of each student and are outlined in the Individualized Education Program (IEP). By providing these additional aids and services, students with disabilities can have equal access to education and participate in activities alongside their peers.
