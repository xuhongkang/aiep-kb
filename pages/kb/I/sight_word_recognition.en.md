# Sight Word Recognition
Sight Word Recognition: Sight word recognition is the ability to quickly and accurately recognize common words without having to sound them out. These words are often difficult to sound out phonetically and appear frequently in written text. Developing sight word recognition is important for improving reading fluency and comprehension. By instantly recognizing these words, readers can focus on understanding the meaning of the text rather than struggling with word decoding. Sight words are typically taught through repetition and practice to build automatic recognition.
