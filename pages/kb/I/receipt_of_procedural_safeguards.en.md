# Receipt Of Procedural Safeguards
Receipt Of Procedural Safeguards: Receipt of procedural safeguards refers to the written document provided to parents of students with disabilities explaining their rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) when it comes to their child's education. These safeguards include the right to participate in the development of the Individualized Education Program (IEP), the right to review records, the right to request evaluations, and the right to resolve disputes through due process. It is important for parents to review and understand these safeguards in order to advocate effectively for their child's educational needs.
