# Iep Meeting Participants
Iep Meeting Participants: IEP Meeting Participants are the individuals who attend the Individualized Education Program meetings. Typically, the participants include the parents or guardians of the student, at least one general education teacher, at least one special education teacher, a school representative who is knowledgeable about resources and can make decisions on behalf of the school, and sometimes the student themselves if they are old enough. The participants collaborate to discuss the student's progress, needs, goals, and any necessary accommodations or modifications.
