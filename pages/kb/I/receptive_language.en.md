# Receptive Language
Receptive Language: Receptive language refers to a person's ability to understand and comprehend spoken language. It involves listening, processing information, and interpreting what is being said. Individuals with receptive language challenges may have difficulty following directions, understanding concepts, or staying engaged in conversations. Assessments and therapy can help improve these skills in individuals with receptive language difficulties. Understanding receptive language is important for developing communication skills and is often addressed in Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) for students with speech and language needs.
