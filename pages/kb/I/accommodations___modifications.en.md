# Accommodations / Modifications
Accommodations / Modifications: Accommodations and modifications are adjustments made to a student's learning environment to help them succeed in their education. Accommodations change how a student learns or demonstrates their knowledge without altering the curriculum's content. Examples include extended time on tests or use of assistive technology. Modifications, on the other hand, involve changing what a student is expected to learn or demonstrate while still achieving educational goals. An example of a modification is reducing the number of math problems to be solved. These adjustments are essential components of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to support students with diverse learning needs.
