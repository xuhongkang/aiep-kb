# Consent
Consent: Consent in the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) refers to the permission given by parents or guardians before any actions related to the creation or implementation of an IEP can take place. This includes evaluations, assessments, and the development of the IEP itself. It is important for parents to actively participate in the IEP process by providing informed consent at each step to ensure that their child's unique needs are accurately assessed and addressed. Without consent, the school may not proceed with certain actions regarding the student's education.
