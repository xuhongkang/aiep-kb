# Parent/Guardian/Surrogate
Parent/Guardian/Surrogate: A parent, guardian, or surrogate is a person who is legally responsible for a child and plays a vital role in the development and educational success of the child. In the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), parents, guardians, or surrogates are important members of the IEP team. They provide valuable insights into the child's strengths, needs, and preferences, and actively participate in the IEP meetings to ensure that the child receives appropriate special education services. Their involvement is crucial for creating a meaningful and effective IEP that meets the unique needs of the child.
