# Articulation/Phonology
Articulation/Phonology: Articulation refers to the way speech sounds are pronounced, while phonology focuses on the way sounds are used within a particular language. In the context of an Individualized Education Program (IEP), articulation and phonology goals may be included to address speech sound errors and difficulties in producing sounds correctly. These goals help students improve their speech clarity and overall communication skills. Speech therapists work with students to target specific sounds and patterns, using techniques like practice exercises, modeling, and feedback to enhance their speech production. By addressing articulation and phonology challenges in the IEP, students receive tailored support to improve their speech abilities and enhance their academic and social interactions.
