# Writing Composition
Writing Composition: Writing composition refers to the process of putting words and sentences together to create a coherent and organized piece of writing. It involves structuring ideas, formulating sentences, and effectively communicating thoughts on paper. In an Individualized Education Program (IEP), writing composition goals may focus on improving a student's ability to express ideas clearly, use appropriate grammar and vocabulary, and organize written work. By setting specific objectives and strategies in the IEP, educators can provide tailored support to help the student develop their writing skills.
