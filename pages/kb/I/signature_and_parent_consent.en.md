# Signature And Parent Consent
Signature And Parent Consent: Signature and parent consent in the context of an Individualized Education Program (IEP) refer to the requirement for parents to provide their written approval for the development and implementation of their child's IEP. The parent's signature indicates their agreement with the goals, objectives, and services outlined in the IEP. Parental consent is crucial for ensuring that the IEP team, which includes parents, teachers, and school administrators, collaborates effectively to address the student's unique needs and provide appropriate educational support. Without parental consent, the IEP cannot be implemented or revised.
