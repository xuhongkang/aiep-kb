# Student/Adult Student
Student/Adult Student: In the context of Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), a Student or Adult Student refers to the individual who is receiving special education services. For students with disabilities in schools, the term 'student' is used, while for those above the school age, the term 'adult student' is employed. These individuals are at the center of the IEP process, where a personalized plan is developed to meet their unique educational needs. The IEP outlines the goals, services, accommodations, and supports tailored to the specific student to help them succeed in their academic pursuits.
