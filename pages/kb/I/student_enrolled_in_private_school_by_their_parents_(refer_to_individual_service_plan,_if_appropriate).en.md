# Student Enrolled In Private School By Their Parents (Refer To Individual Service Plan, If Appropriate)
Student Enrolled In Private School By Their Parents (Refer To Individual Service Plan, If Appropriate): When a student is enrolled in a private school by their parents and requires specialized support, an Individualized Education Program (IEP) might not apply, but instead, an Individual Service Plan (ISP) can be created. The ISP outlines the special services and supports the student will receive to help them succeed academically. It may include accommodations, modifications, and additional resources tailored to the student's unique needs. While an IEP is specifically for students attending public schools and is guided by federal law, an ISP is often used for students in private schools to ensure they receive appropriate assistance.
