# Receipt Of The Individualized Education Plan (Iep)
Receipt Of The Individualized Education Plan (Iep): Receipt of the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) refers to the process where the parents/guardians of a student with disabilities are given a copy of their child's IEP. This important document outlines the unique academic, behavioral, and social-emotional needs of the student, along with the support services and accommodations they will receive to help them succeed in school. The receipt of the IEP allows parents to review the goals, services, and progress monitoring plans outlined for their child's education and collaborate with the school to ensure the student's needs are being met effectively.
