# Esy Services
Esy Services: Extended School Year (ESY) Services are special education and related services provided to students with disabilities beyond the regular school year to prevent regression of skills. These services are determined on an individualized basis through the student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) team based on the student's specific needs. ESY services are designed to maintain the progress made during the school year and ensure continuous growth. They may include academic support, related services, and other interventions tailored to the child's requirements.
